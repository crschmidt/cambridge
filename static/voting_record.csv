­­­­Public Investment Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditure to provide
funds for the construction costs for the Clarendon Avenue Playground.

The above amount, when added to the $260,000 appropriated from Community
Preservation Funds in FY16, will bring the total project cost to $960,000. The
amount requested through Community Preservation Funds in FY16 was in
anticipation of additional funding to complete construction. This project was
considered as part of the Community Preservation Act process, but it was
determined at that time by the City that a separate appropriation from Free
Cash was the best way to finance this additional appropriation.

This open space renovation project will involve a comprehensive redesign of
the park, including new equipment, surfacing, seating areas, passive elements,
and landscaping.

The design will include a community process which is expected to begin later
in 2016, followed by construction on the park.

1872,5044," A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to a request that the City Council vote to designate the contracted part-time position of property appraiser as a special municipal employee for purposes of the state Conflict of Interest Law, G.L.c.268A.","I request that the City Council vote to designate the contracted part-time
position of property appraiser as a special municipal employee for purposes of
the state Conflict of Interest Law, G.L.c.268A, by adopting the attached
Order.

The City occasionally contracts with third-party property appraisers to
perform appraisals for the City. For purposes of the Massachusetts Conflict of
Interest Law, when the City contracts with a particular appraiser, that
appraiser is considered a regular municipal employee, subject to all the
Conflict of Interest Law’s restrictions on regular municipal employees. If the
City Council designates this position to be that of a special municipal
employee, certain of the Conflict of Interest Law’s restrictions would apply
less broadly to such individuals, including G.L.c.268A, s.17 which pertains in
part to acting as agent for third parties on matters of interest to the City,
and G.L.c.268A, s.20 which pertains to having more than one contract with the
same City. Some contracted property appraisers have requested that the
position of contracted property appraiser be designated by the City Council as
a special municipal employee so that the Conflict of Interest Law will not
excessively restrict their private professional activities.

Pursuant to G.L.c.268A, positions, not individuals, may be designated as
special municipal employees by vote of the City Council if the position is
part-time allowing work by the individual holding the position at another job
during normal working hours; or the position is not paid by the city for more
than 800 working hours during a 365 day period. The position at issue meets
both of these conditions.

G.L.c.268A, s.17 generally prohibits municipal employees from representing a
private party before municipal boards or departments. It also prohibits
municipal employees from acting as agent for a private party in connection
with any matter of direct and substantial interest to their city or town.
Finally, it prohibits municipal employees from accepting pay or other
compensation in connection with any matter of direct and substantial interest
to their municipality. However, a special municipal employee may: (a)
represent private parties before municipal boards other than his/her own in
certain circumstances; (b) act as agent for private parties in connection with
a matter of interest to the City in certain circumstances; and (c) receive pay
or other compensation in connection with matters involving the City in certain
circumstances.  
  
G.L.c.268A, s.20 generally prohibits municipal employees from having a direct
or indirect financial interest in a contract with their city or town. However,
a special municipal employee has the following exemptions to section 20: A
special municipal employee may have a financial interest in a contract with a
department which is completely independent of the one where he/she works,
provided that a disclosure is filed with the City Clerk. A special municipal
employee may have a financial interest in a contract with his/her own
department, with the appropriate disclosure and approvals. A special municipal
employee may also hold any number of other special municipal employee
positions, with the appropriate disclosure and approvals.  
  
Therefore, for the above reasons, I request that the City Council vote to
designate the position of contracted part-time property appraiser as that of a
special municipal employee.

1557,2104, City Council opposition to investing funds from the Cambridge Retirement System in any entities that are involved in or support the production or upgrading of nuclear weapons systems.,"WHEREAS:

|

Nations across the globe still maintain over 15,000 nuclear weapons, some of
which are hundreds of times more powerful than those that obliterated
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and detonation of even a small fraction of these
weapons could create a decade-long nuclear winter that could destroy most of
the Earth’s population; and  
  
---|---

WHEREAS:

|

The United States has plans to [invest roughly one trillion dollars over the
coming decades](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/us-begin-1-trillion-upgrade-nuclear-

terrorism, and accidental nuclear war; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

In a period where federal funds are desperately needed in communities like
Cambridge in order to build affordable housing, improve public transit, and

weapons](http://www2.cambridgema.gov/cityClerk/policyOrder.cfm?item_id=32512),

Obama to lead the nuclear disarmament effort; now therefore be it

Retirement System in any entities that are involved in or support the

ORDERED:

requested to report back to the City Council about the implementation of said
divestment in a timely manner.

Rossi Housing Assistance Fund (the “Fund”), and that $35,641.46 in donations received be appropriated into this Fund.","I would like to request that the City Council establish the Richard C. Rossi
Housing Assistance Fund (the “Fund”), and that $35,641.46 in donations
received be appropriated into this Fund. The proposed Fund is attached hereto
for the City Council’s review and approval, together with the proposed
Procedures and Guidelines for the Fund.  
  
With the retirement of City Manager Richard Rossi, the Housing Assistance Fund
in his name was established through the Friends of Richard Rossi, and
donations were received for this fund during the fall of 2016.  
  
The purpose of this Fund is to provide limited emergency financial assistance
to residents experiencing difficulty remaining housed Cambridge. Pending
availability, the Fund will be used to assist Cambridge residents primarily in
the following areas:

· First month’s rent (and, where required, last month’s) and security deposit
for households needing these funds in order to lease a new unit (e.g. for an
inclusionary unit) - funds could supplement funds offered through other
sources including the Multi-Service Center;

· Funds for families at risk of foreclosure due to mortgage and/or condo fee
arrearages - there are currently no funds available for this which can be a
significant issue for lower income homeowners as fees and legal costs can
quickly add significantly when an owner falls behind in payments.

· Credit repair - credit can be a big barrier to accessing housing, especially
for lower income applicants with poor credit. Access to funds to address (with
some limit) credit issues to repair credit could help some applicants who are
now denied based on credit; and

· Funds for families at risk of homelessness due to rent arrearages - funds
could supplement funds offered through other and/or be offered to households
who are not eligible for other funds.

I am very pleased to be recommending the creation of this Fund and I
respectfully request that the City Council approve the creation of the Fund in
the form attached hereto. As City Manager and Deputy City Manager, Richard
Rossi was dedicated to the creation and preservation of affordable housing and
improving access to affordable housing in Cambridge. The Richard C. Rossi
Housing Assistance Fund will, in Mr. Rossi’s name, continue this commitment by
helping residents access new housing and assisting in efforts to keep
residents with housing risks suitably housed in Cambridge.

This City Council is deeply saddened by the loss of Mrs. Nancy Maguire

peacefully, surrounded by love ones, in Naples, Florida; and  
  
---|---  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

Born Nancy Ballantine Maguire in Cambridge on November 21, 1927, Mrs. Hoffman
developed a love of learning and an appreciation for family at the knee of her
parents: John MacArthur Maguire, an esteemed lawyer, writer, and Harvard
Professor, and Mary Hume, a college professor and staunch advocate of civil
and human rights; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

Nancy was raised with a strong appreciation for justice, nature, curiosity,
and humanism, which was nurtured during her time at Shady Hill School in
Cambridge, MA and later at Colorado College where she earned a degree in
English; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

Following her graduation, Nancy started work at the Lowell Institute
Cooperative Broadcasting Council, which became public radio and television
station WGBH in Boston, where she rose through the ranks, interviewing
celebrities on-air and becoming one of the first female producers and
directors in television; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

At WGBH, she met a young composer, Theodore B. Hoffman, who she would later
marry, and together, they would go on to have four children: Heather,
Theodore, Jeffrey, and Jennifer; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

Even though the family moved to Tampa, Florida in 1962 after Mr. Hoffman was
hired as Composer-in-Residence and Professor of Humanities at the University
of South Florida, Nancy always considered herself to be a Cantabrigian; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

It was in Tampa, Florida where the Hoffman’s set down their roots and where
Nancy became deeply involved in the Hillsborough County school system, sitting
on advisory panels and counseling countless students about college placement
and application forms; and

WHEREAS:

|

Her tenacious versatility later was rewarded with a life-time achievement
award from the county, honoring her 40 years of service; and

Nancy also enjoyed sports, rooting particularly hard for the Red Sox, Celtics,
Patriots and other Boston teams; and

WHEREAS:

Nancy loved attending concerts, many featuring her husband's music, and adored
cooking, lively conversation, laughter, old movies, soap operas, pets, good
books and visits to the ocean; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

Nancy was a devoted and loving mother who doted on her family, encouraging her
children academically, musically, and professionally; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

Nancy and her husband traveled extensively both domestically and abroad, yet
she was a firm believer in the power of voting and always found time to
volunteer at the polls; and

WHEREAS:

|

Nancy was preceded in death by her husband in 2003, and she leaves behind four

Alexander, Jessica and Amanda (children of Jeff and Suroj Hoffman); and Kevin,

These acquisitions were considered as part of the City’s capital plan, but it
was determined that a separate appropriation was the best way to finance this
equipment. Over the past five years, the City has pulled Fire equipment
purchases out of the pay-as-you go capital plan due to their extraordinary
costs.

The aerial ladder was purchased in 1994 and has served just under 23 years.
The ISO rating system does not give credit for equipment 25 years or older
regardless of condition.

The two paramedic squad units will replace the vehicles located at Engine 4
(Porter Square) and Engine 2 (Lafayette Square). Both units will be replaced
with a modular style body utilizing a standard pick-up chassis. This will
allow for a more cost effective chassis remount replacement in future years
rather than a complete vehicle purchase. The current vehicles were purchased
in 2005.

Lastly, the 2004 ambulance that is used by the Rescue Company will be taken
out of service. The new vehicle will support our (OEMS) Office of Emergency

review and inspections by ISD, among other increased demands on ISD’s staff.

inspections of sheet metal installation and additional review of plans for so-
called Green Buildings for compliance with the Energy Code. Building Permits
for the construction of three residential dwelling units or less are exempt
from the fee increase to $20.00 per thousand, as set forth in the proposed
Building Permit Fee schedule.

The Building Permit Fees are set by the Municipal Code, and therefore they may

1559,2214, That the City Council go on record asking the Massachusetts State Legislature to review the symbolism of the Official Seal of Massachusetts to determine whether it may be perpetuating or promoting hurtful symbolism.,"WHEREAS:

|

In recent years, there has been a growing national discussion around the
symbolism behind many statues, flags, and official seals focusing on whether
these cultural touchstones, many of which are hundreds of years old, may
contain elements that could be construed as hurtful and divisive in modern
society; and  
  
---|---

This national conversation has touched upon everything from [the flag of the
Confederacy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-
nation/wp/2015/07/10/watch-live-as-the-confederate-flag-comes-down-in-south-
carolina/), to the [seal of Harvard Law
School](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/3/4/law-school-seal-report/),
to the names of [professional sports teams](http://www.ncai.org/proudtobe),
with the recognition that what was socially acceptable symbolism 300 years ago
may now be in conflict with our modern values and perceptions; and

WHEREAS:

In light of the larger national discussion, some voices in the community have
been urging that the [Official Seal of the Commonwealth of

be given closer scrutiny, with the argument being made that the seal may
contain symbols that degrade specific segments of our society, or that may
celebrate events that we may not wish to glorify; now therefore be it

For Free has reported that they have raised $75,000 in specifically earmarked

remaining funds necessary to close the funding gap for this year and we are in
communication with Food For Free to discuss how the City will support the

Star Pool Site”) and to construct subsurface geothermal wells in a portion of
Donnelly Field that lies directly along and adjacent to the current southerly
boundary of the KOCSUS site (the “School Site”).

Specifically, relief is required from the Legislature to construct a portion
of the KOCSUS Project on the existing Gold Star Pool Site, which occupies a
small portion of the currently existing School Site that was not included in
Chapter 49 of the Acts of 1955 (the “1955 Legislation”) by which a portion of
the original Donnelly Field site (that had comprised the entire block
stretching easterly from Cambridge Street to Berkshire Street, south along
Berkshire to York Street, west along York to Willow and then north along
Willow to Cambridge Street (“Original Donnelly Field Site”)) was authorized to
be changed from its then “public park and park purposes” and re-used “for the
erection of a public school building, and for other school purposes, and for
all purposes incidental thereto”. When the 1955 Legislation was passed, the
portion of what was to become the School Site remained part of the Original
Donnelly Field Site to continue to be used for “public park and park” purposes
because it was used and occupied by the Gold Star Pool prior to 1955. It
continues to be used and occupied by the Gold Star Pool today.

Relief is also required from the Legislature to construct subsurface
geothermal wells within a portion of Donnelly Field that lies directly along
and adjacent to the southern edge of the School Site. All existing “public
park and park” uses that are conducted in that part of Donnelly Field will
continue to be conducted after the installation of the subsurface geothermal
wells.

Pursuant to Article 97 of the Articles of Amendment to the Constitution of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts (“Article 97”), land that is held and dedicated
for parkland uses may only be re-used for another use with the consent of two
thirds of both houses of the Legislature.

BACKGROUND

1. The Gold Star Pool

The City’s architect has completed the Schematic Design phase for the KOCSUS
Project. The design for the KOCSUS Project includes reconstruction of the Gold
Star Pool and moving the pool south of the existing location. The new location
of the Gold Star Pool, which will be adjacent to Berkshire Street and Donnelly
Field, will be beneficial to the City and the community because it allows for
a larger pool and deck space, a new wading pool, and it faces south with a
direct connection to Donnelly Field. The proposed new location allows better
visibility from Berkshire Street and Donnelly Field. The new location is
smaller than the existing location (11,773 sf verses 17,890 sf); however, it
will provide a more optimized and efficient building layout for the overall
Project. The new pool house and changing rooms will be located on the first
level of the three story building, and the school administrative offices will
be located above the pool house and changing rooms.

2. Geothermal Wells

The KOCSUS Project is being designed as a Net Zero Emissions (“NZE”) project.
The two main systems helping to facilitate that goal are photovoltaic panels
(“PV”) which produce electricity, and the subsurface geothermal wells that
provide tempered water for heating and cooling the building. The PVs are
primarily on the roof and the geothermal wells will be below grade. The
subsurface geothermal wells will be installed in areas that will not have any
building structures above them. The new building and site design will
significantly increase the green space around the Project buildings at the
School Site.

The Project design requires 190 wells. They are spaced 20’ apart, and even
with the additional green space on the Project Site, the 190 wells cannot all
fit within the existing School Site. The area outside of the School Site that
is proposed for the balance of the subsurface geothermal wells is the strip of
land along the northern edge of Donnelly Field between Willow and Berkshire
Streets that is presently used for a seating area, basketball courts, and the
Frisoli play area. In the final constructed condition, the subsurface
geothermal wells and piping will reside underground and remain unseen while
the disturbed surface will be restored and replaced with a new park,
basketball courts and seating area.

HOME RULE LEGISLATION

Both the area proposed for the construction of the subsurface geothermal wells
and the Gold Star Pool are presently located in parts of the Original Donnelly
Field Site, which is owned and held by the City for “public park and park”
purposes and therefore is protected under Article 97 from any change in use
absent legislation authorizing such a change in use. In order to proceed with
the design of the Project as planned, to construct the subsurface geothermal
wells within a portion of Donnelly Field and to use the Gold Star Pool Site as
part of the overall site for the Project, I ask that the City Council vote in
favor of filing the attached Home Rule Petition.

I have attached for your information a site plan and plan attachment sheets
depicting the restrictions on the existing Original Donnelly Field Site, the
description of the requests and benefits of the proposed changes that are
requested, site renderings showing the existing and proposed site conditions,
and calculations relating to the existing and proposed pool locations at the
proposed Project Site.

(the “Chamber”) with regard to the City’s eminent domain taking of the Chamber’s property on June 13, 2016.","I am writing to recommend that the City Council approve and appropriate the
payment of an additional One Million, Two Hundred Thirty-Six Thousand, One
Hundred Twenty-Five ($1,236,125) Dollars from Free Cash to the General Fund
Law Department Travel &amp; Training (Judgment &amp; Damages) account, in
order to settle the damages to be paid to the Cambridge Chamber of Commerce,
Inc. (the “Chamber”) with regard to the City’s eminent domain taking of the
Chamber’s property on June 13, 2016. The property is a parcel of land
comprising approximately 5,000 square feet of land located at 859
Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge (the “Property”). On June 13, 2016, the
Council approved an Order to take the Property by eminent domain and an Order
appropriating the estimated pro tanto payment to be paid to the Chamber for
the Property in the amount of One Million, Three Hundred Sixty-Three Thousand,
Eight Hundred Seventy-Five ($1,363,875) Dollars, as damages deemed sufficient
by the Chief Assessor to cover the estimated pro tanto payment (the average
three prior years’ assessed value plus twenty-five 25% percent (the Factor
Maximum Value)) toward the expenses of acquisition as required by the
previously referenced Sections of Chapters 40 and 43 of the General Laws. This
is the maximum that the City can pay as a pro tanto payment for a property
that is being taken by eminent domain.  
  
As I informed the Council, under the law, the property owner has the right to
challenge the amount of the pro tanto payment in a legal proceeding and could
seek to persuade a court that it is entitled to the actual fair market value
of the property as well as certain other statutory damages such as relocation
costs. I informed you on June 13 that I would initiate a settlement of any
such claim with the property owner once the City Council voted to authorize
the taking of this Property by eminent domain.  
  
The Council authorized me in Executive Session to negotiate a value to be paid
in settlement of the Chamber’s damages claim in the event that the Property
was taken by eminent domain. As previously discussed with the Council in
Executive Session, I have obtained a confidential appraisal of the Property
which was performed by Mr. Steven Foster. Mr. Foster has determined in his
appraisal that the fair market value of the Property is Two Million, Six
Hundred Thousand ($2,600,000) Dollars.  
  
I am pleased to report that after obtaining and reviewing the appraisal from
Mr. Foster I have successfully reached a settlement with the Chamber to
resolve the damages claim, which will result in the total amount to be paid to
the Chamber for the Property of Two Million, Six Hundred Thousand ($2,600,000)
Dollars. In exchange for the additional payment of One Million, Two Hundred
Thirty-Six Thousand, One Hundred Twenty-Five ($1,236,125) Dollars, the City
will receive an executed general release from the Chamber which will release
the City from any and all further liability to the Chamber arising out of this
eminent domain taking of the Property. I am therefore returning to the Council
now to request a further appropriation in the amount of One Million, Two
Hundred Thirty-Six Thousand, One Hundred Twenty-Five ($1,236,125) Dollars,
which would constitute a final agreed total damages award to the Chamber in
the amount of Two Million, Six Hundred Thousand ($2,600,000) Dollars for the
taking of this Property; and I am further requesting that the Council
authorize me to settle the damages claim in that amount.

  
  
I look forward to discussing this matter with you and answering any questions
that you may have.

the Public Investment Fund Community Development Extraordinary Expenditure
account for the acquisition of two parcels of the Watertown Branch railroad
from B&amp;M Corporation for the purpose of creating a future multi-use path
and greenway.

BACKGROUND: The 2005 Concord-Alewife Plan identified the acquisition of the
remaining Watertown Branch parcels and creation of a path as a priority for
the area in order to create additional off-road connections to Danehy Park,
Fresh Pond Mall and to create the possible future connection to a multiuse
path along the Fitchburg Line to Porter Square. At that time a zoning overlay
district was created to encourage the preservation of the rail line as open
space and conversion to a greenway and multi-use path.

FUTURE PLAN: This path will be an extension of the existing path along Fresh
Pond Parkway that is also currently being extended into Watertown through a
partnership between the City of Cambridge and the state Department of
Conservation and Recreation (DCR) known as the Watertown Cambridge Greenway.
Funds would also be used to complete a conceptual design needed to identify
opportunities, constraints and an approximate cost to construct the path in
the future.

Alewife is a busy area with many transportation needs and opportunities. A
robust and expanding off-road, multi-use path network is part of those
facilities, and is needed to encourage sustainable trips in the Alewife area
to reduce existing congestion. Paths through the area make many regional
connections into Arlington (Minuteman Bikeway), Belmont (Alewife Greenway
Extension), and Somerville (Alewife Greenway). The extended Watertown-
Cambridge Greenway will complete the connection between Cambridge and
Watertown as well as the regional link between the Minuteman Bikeway and the
Charlies River path system.

General Fund Community Development Other Ordinary account to complete a Low
Carbon Energy Supply Study.

The City Council adopted the Cambridge Net Zero Action Plan in June 2015. To
achieve net zero and improve community resilience for Cambridge buildings, it
will require a significant shift in the supply of energy away from fossil fuel
based sources and toward low- or zero-carbon sources. This will include
realizing a significant portion of the city’s solar potential, taking
advantage of all opportunities to harvest waste heat, and expanding and
developing additional district energy capacity. The Low Carbon Energy Supply
Strategy, Action 3.1 of the Net Zero Action Plan, aims to define for the City
of Cambridge how it will support the broad implementation and development of
renewable and low carbon energy in Cambridge.  
  
The Environmental and Transportation Planning Division will hire and manage a
consultant to complete the following tasks:

• Map low carbon energy resources that could be developed into district energy
(either new district energy systems and/or tied into existing systems);

• Identify opportunities based on both technical and business case analysis to
develop district cooling - this will include the mapping of current and future
heating demand and the capacity of the current building stock to adapt to
district scale solutions;

• Identify opportunities based on both technical and business case analysis to
either develop and/or expand combined heat and power at the block or district
scale for micro-grids;

• In partnership with Eversource, map and provide technical analysis, with
accompanying recommendations, on the constraints and opportunities posed by
the current electrical grid with regards to its ability to integrate
electricity from solar PV and co-generation;

• Perform a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis
of the various roles that the City can to promote and proliferate low carbon
renewable energy. These could include but not be limited to owning and
operating systems or infrastructure, public private partnerships, franchise
areas, and other enabling legislation;

• Policy options to support the development of low carbon and renewable
energy;

• A review of City of Cambridge capital assets that could either support or
integrate energy generation within them;

• Develop a solar road map, based on Cambridge’s estimated solar potential and
the incremental actions outlined in the evolution of a solar ready
requirement.

• Prioritizing areas of investment for either generation, distribution or
storage of energy;

• Review investment vehicles that can be used to support the development of
low carbon or renewable district energy;  

Review how the market for technologies (solar, batteries, grid infrastructure
etc.) is projected to change over the life of the strategy.

Peterson, Acting City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $3,600,000 from the Water Fund Retained Earnings account to the Water Fund Other Ordinary Maintenance account to fund the purchase of water from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) for approximately three months.","I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $3,600,000 from the Water Fund
Retained Earnings account to the Water Fund Other Ordinary Maintenance account
to fund the purchase of water from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority
(MWRA) for approximately three months.

The Cambridge Water Department (CWD) carefully monitors the City’s water
supply system on a weekly basis to ensure an adequate supply of water is
available to meet the needs of our residents, businesses, and universities. As
the severity of the drought in Massachusetts continues, the usable capacity
remaining in our reservoir system has been declining due to insufficient
rainfall. However, Cambridge is not at risk of running out of water because in
addition to our own water supply, we are a member of the MWRA system, which is
operating at normal conditions for this time of year.

Based on the current reservoir levels and the need to maintain the operability
of the water treatment plant, the CWD initiated the use of MWRA water the
second week of October. This approach will allow CWD to maintain enough water
in our reservoirs to allow the water treatment plant to continue operating at
a minimum of 10 MG per week through the fall of 2017 when the current weather
predictions indicate that the drought will end.

In addition to purchasing water, CWD has expanded our conservation efforts
with top users and universities and will continue to strongly encourage the
practice of indoor and outdoor water conservation wherever possible. While
additional conservation efforts are an important tool for all users of our
water system to participate in, Cambridge’s robust water conservation/water
efficiency programs over the past two decades have resulted in Cambridge users
using significantly less water per user than other communities in the
Commonwealth and will make this more challenging to find significant water
usage savings.

At the plant output of ~10MG per week the cost of MWRA water is estimated to
be $1.2M per month.

Our plan, if necessary, is to appropriate funding on a quarterly basis with
this being our first appropriation from the water fund balance.

Because of the significant cost increases that the CWD will incur by
purchasing water from the MWRA, there will be future financial impacts to the
City. The CWD will continuously monitor the drought and precipitation status
and modify our operational plan to minimize MWRA water usage while maintaining
plant operations and a “healthy” reservoir system. This will also have an
effect on the FY18 water rate and impact the FY18 operating and capital
budgets.

at 1-15 Vail Court, Cambridge, also known as 139 Bishop Allen Drive, (“the
Property”) to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust so that the Trust may
move forward with the redevelopment of the Property as affordable housing for
low- and moderate-income households. I am also requesting that the City
Council appropriate $750,000 for the demolition of the two structures on the
Property.  
  
As you know, in September 2016 the City Council approved the taking of the
Property by eminent domain after many years and much frustration in the
community about blighted condition of buildings there. Since that time the
City has taken ownership of the Property, and has secured and inspected the
two structures there. A Board of Survey has determined that the buildings are
physically unsound and must be demolished. Building inspections have also
shown that the buildings contain hazardous materials.  
  
The City has developed a plan for abatement of hazardous materials and
demolition of the existing structures. Bids have been obtained for this
project and costs are estimated to be $750,000. I am requesting that the City
Council appropriation $750,000 for this effort so that the buildings can be
demolished in the coming months.  
  
While planning for the demolition of the buildings, the City has also
considered how best to advance the redevelopment of the property acknowledging
the interest in using the property for affordable housing expressed by the
City Council when approving the eminent domain order.  
  
The City, through the City Manager’s Office, held a public meeting on March
23, 2017 to update the community on the status of the buildings, and to
solicit additional input on the future use of the Property. The meeting was
attended by more than 50 residents, including abutters, other residents, as
well as representatives from affordable housing organizations. There was
strong support at the meeting for redeveloping the property as affordable
housing. There were also several comments from abutters advocating for the
inclusion of green space, as well as comments that the height, size, and
layout of any new buildings should be appropriate for the neighborhood. Many
meeting attendees also expressed gratitude to the City for taking steps to
address conditions at the Property after many years of frustration.  
  
In keeping with the high priority the City Council has placed on creating
affordable housing and the input we heard from the community, I am
recommending that the City Council approve the authorization to transfer a
leasehold interest in the property to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust
for the construction of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income.
Leasing the land to the Trust for 99 years will allow for the development of
affordable housing while allowing the City to retain ownership of the
underlying land.  
  
The transfer of an interest in real estate to the Trust for the construction
of low- and moderate-income housing is exempt from the provisions of the
Disposition Ordinance, Chapter 2.110 of the Cambridge Municipal Code. Chapter
40, §15A of the General Laws governs the transfer of municipal property from
one municipal use to another. Ordinarily, General Laws Chapter 40, § 15A
requires a two-thirds vote for such a transfer; however, the statute provides
that when the transfer is for the purpose of constructing low- and moderate-
income housing, a simple majority vote is required.  
  
I believe that the Affordable Housing Trust is best suited to initiate the
redevelopment of the Property as affordable housing in a way that balances
community housing needs with the desire for an appropriately scaled
development and site layout. The Trust will also ensure that the City’s
investment in the Property is leveraged with other public and private funding
to complete high-quality development that benefits the community.  
  
Next Steps  
  
The City has scheduled a community meeting for June 14, 2017 to update the
community on the plan for hazardous material abatement and demolition.
Abatement and demolition work is expected to occur in the coming months.  
  
City staff will also begin work with the Trust to schedule public meetings to
solicit information on city-wide housing needs and identify possible
affordable housing uses so that the best affordable housing use of the
Property can be determined. City staff and the Trust will also work with the
City Manager’s office, the Community Development Department, neighbors, and
other stakeholders, to develop guidance for the chosen developer around
building and site design, to ensure a thoughtfully designed development that
will benefit future residents of the housing as well as the surrounding
neighborhood. The Trust will incorporate identified affordable housing
objective(s) and guidelines for site design to into a Request for
Qualifications (RFQ) to select a developer capable of carrying out the project
as envisioned.  
  
To continue progress with advancing efforts to redevelop the property, I
recommend the City Council appropriate of $750,000 from Free Cash to the
Public Investment Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures Account to
facilitate the abatement and demolition of the existing structures on the
site, and that the City Council also approve authorization to transfer the a
leasehold interest in property to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust for
the construction of low- and moderate-income housing.

General Fund Human Services Salaries and Wages account ($60,000) and to the
General Fund Human Services Other Ordinary Maintenance Account ($90,000) to be
used to support the beginning implementation work of the Early Childhood Task
Force’s recommendations.  
  
As you recall, in November, the Early Childhood Task Force delivered its
report to a joint meeting of the City Council and School Committee. The
powerful vision for early childhood that guided the development of the report
was:  

All children in Cambridge receive high quality early education and care from
birth through third grade. As a result, all children enter school ready to
thrive academically, socially, emotionally and continue to do so through third
grade and beyond.  

The report included a set of recommendations to the City to support the
development of an early childhood system. The Task Force was made up of city
and school department representatives, parents, health and early childhood
experts from community based organizations and family childcare settings. With
support from national experts in the field, we reviewed the research to
identify best practices nationally and locally. We engaged in a needs
assessment process, surveying local providers and doing focus groups with
parents, principals, teachers, early childhood providers and others. What
emerged from the research and the needs assessment confirmed the availability
of many strong programs and services within Cambridge, but also confirmed the
significant challenges families and providers face without a coherent system
that links families, early childhood providers, and the schools. The Task
Force recognized that it would be a multi-year ongoing effort to build an
effective early childhood system that would improve the outcomes for
Cambridge’s children.  
  
The report proposed that a critical first step in this process was to create
an effective Birth through Third Grade governance structure tasked with
turning the recommendations of this report into a full-fledged strategic plan
with measurable goals and benchmarks. The governance structure will include
the full range of stakeholders in the Cambridge’s early education and care
community including families, early childhood providers, school and city
officials, higher education partners and health/mental health partners. The
governance body will be charged with overseeing the development and
implementation of the strategic plan. Also critical to the implementation of
the plan is the development of agreed upon quality standards in early learning
settings since Cambridge’s children are served in a diverse array of programs
and settings. Family support and family engagement play a central role in the
Early Childhood Task Force report, and developing strategies and benchmarks in
those areas is also critical.  
  
In November, I had indicated that I would be returning to the City Council
with a request for an appropriation for start-up funds to be used in this
fiscal year to position the City to begin the implementation work in the next
fiscal year. The funds would be used to hire the Early Childhood Director and
the Program Quality Specialist and to work with our consultants and key
stakeholders to develop a significant portion of the draft strategic plan,
which will include preliminary process and outcome benchmarks for governance,
quality, access and family engagement.  
  
The costs for start-up in this fiscal year are $150,000. Of that amount,
$60,000 represents the initial salary for the two positions for the last part
of FY16 and funding to continue the work to support the Birth to Grade 3
alignment work with community providers. An additional $90,000 will support
the work with stakeholders in developing the draft strategic plan and draft
outcomes and benchmarks, development and analysis of alternate scholarship
systems for supporting access within quality programs, and to explore models
for a quality pilot with community sites. We will also be developing more
accurate information for the proposed budget for FY17 by the spring, but we
anticipate that the costs will be approximately 1.3 million dollars. Those
costs would grow by approximately another one million dollars for year 2,
FY18.

The Public Safety Committee held a public hearing on December 14, 2015
beginning at 3:02 P.M. in the Sullivan Chamber.

The purpose of the hearing was to discuss the climate change vulnerability
assessment.

Present at the hearing were Councillor Craig Kelley, Chair of the Committee,
Councillor Dennis J. Carlone, Councillor E. Denise Simmons, Councillor Marc
McGovern, Councillor Nadeem Mazen, Susanne Rasmussen, Director, Environmental
and Transportation Planning Division of Community Development Department, Owen
O’Riordan, Public Works Commissioner, Kathy Watkins, City Engineer, Sam
Lipson, Director, Environmental Health, Public Health Department and City
Clerk  
Donna P. Lopez.

Also present were Jan Devereux, 255 Lakeview Avenue, Megan Brooks, 103 Inman
Street, Ann F. Durbin, 78 Pearson Avenue, Somerville, Andrea Wilder, 12
Arlington Street and Robert Winters, 366 Broadway.

Councillor Kelley convened the hearing and explained the purpose. He submitted
an agenda for the hearing (ATTACHMENT A). He explained the format. He would
give his overview, then City staff and general discussion. The Climate Change
Vulnerability Assessment Report (CCVA) is focused on sea level rise and storm
water surge, precipitation and temperature with three planning horizons.
Experts talk about things using terms that regular people do not understand.
He stated that if the City wants the CCVA report taken seriously it needs to
be understandable from the public perspective. He spoke about the need for
graphics rather than text. He stated that this needs to be sold similar to an
insurance project. He asked city staff to explain the CCVA process.

Susanne Rasmussen, CDD, stated that the themes were selected from
conversations with climate change experts and scientist. Heat, sea level rise
and storm surge were identified as threats. The findings from the climate
change study will be published in February. The scope of the plan is being
finalized. The biggest challenge is to integrate this with the city-wide plan
which will cover the preparedness plan. She stated that on December 3rd the
City held a public meeting to discuss climate change issues and how to address
the threats. She stated that there is a regional collaboration about climate
change preparedness.

Commissioner O'Riordan stated that smaller groups in the community will meet
to have conversations about climate change, to see the impacts and to
understand the concerns of various communities about climate change. He stated
that the City takes climate change impacts seriously over the short and long
term. There needs to be consensus for change.

Sam Lipson spoke about the health aspects in the assessment. This is meant to
create a realistic view. The direct relationship increase in heat and
mortality is impressive. What is the additional stress to a population? There
was a challenge in the assessment to talk about the health effect
appropriately and there is not a lot of consensus on what is going to happen
with temperature increases. He stated that in the City’s technical report you
will see more talk about disease vectors like mosquito borne illnesses, etc.
identified as issues to be concerned about as they relate to climate change.
This is meant to be look at a system risk perspective and includes the keeping
of food, food safety and distribution problems. Systemic risks such as power
outages will be considered. This type of information is not in the report that
has been released but will be in a future white paper that talks about what
happens under various likely scenarios.

Councillor Kelley asked how we manage the information, knowledge and events
such as the public meetings to be held. How is the public informed of the
meetings? How do we get a representative public involved? Ms. Rasmussen noted
that all the public meetings are advertised and the web site will reflect all
activities. The smaller meetings will be arranged from direct outreach. Mr.
O'Riordan stated that neighborhood groups, pastors, business organization will
be utilized with the hope that this information be transferred to other
interested persons. Extreme heat and flooding are primary means that climate
change will affect us with secondary issues such as power outages, food
security and then illnesses. The initial thoughts are for City staff to go to
organizations in the community and ask people who are interested in this to
participate with the City in this matter. It is a new area for City staff and
they want to be flexible in their approach. The CCVA is a stress test and as
we move to the preparedness plan additional stresses will be studied and put
into the public domain. The assessment took three years and the planning is
probably going to take two. The best science and engineering was used for the
assessment and the complex modeling required special computing access which
led to delays. He stated that meetings have been scheduled for Harvard Square
and Mid-Cambridge neighborhood association. Ms. Rasmussen stated that all
activities will be posted when they are finalized. The two meetings are not
posted now. Councillor Kelley wanted to go to the web site and map out the
City meetings scheduled. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that staff is being
asked to attend association meetings and are on their agenda for 5-10 minutes.
He stated that Councillor Kelley's wishes will be respected to post the
meetings.

Councillor McGovern stated that neighborhood organizations are good places to
go. He stated that only the most robust neighborhood organizations represent a
true segment of the neighbors. He suggested working with the school
department, perhaps through their curriculum, and to have larger meetings with
the community. He stated that outreach at the neighborhood organizations are
only a piece of the notification process. He suggested using the City Council
to promote these meetings as well. Ms. Rasmussen stated that the City-wide
Master Plan outreach will be a significant way to talk to people. This will
start in the Alewife area. The CCVA is such a critical part of forward
planning.

Councillor Carlone stated that there are critical zones that will be impacted.
He suggested having meetings in these areas. He suggested using television and
cable. He spoke of the impact of state bridges and roads blocking effective
drainage and making flooding worse. How has the state been involved?
Commissioner O'Riordan it was through DOT’s Central Artery study that the City
obtained its modeling. He also stated that Department of Conservation &amp;
Resources (DCR) has looked at their bridges and dams (Craddick Dam on Mystic
River and the Charles River Dam). He spoke about the importance of having
these systems operate correctly even for less significant storm events and the
critical importance of having the pumps working for major events. The City is
looking at regional flood prevention efforts, especially for big events, and
Mass DOT must be involved.

Councillor Carlone spoke about Route 2 development, the fact that Route 2 acts
as a type of dam, and the option of expanding wetlands and greenspace and
looking at water retention. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that maps produced
are results of rare events projected for 2070. But smaller events, 5-10 years,
need to be understood as well as even with non-major events, flooding can
overwhelm the bridges and drainage systems and once on the site, water cannot
easily be removed. He stated that the smaller events can benefit from storm
water management planning but that, realistically, there is not much that can
be done for major storm water events like a 100 year storm. In that case, our
efforts are simply going to be inconsequential.

Councillor Simmons spoke about the importance of outreach to the community and
its two part nature - normal, customary people and the harder to reach people.
She suggested looking at the neighborhood and proposing to reach 10% of the
neighborhood and break it down to ethnicity. She wanted to see this data
broken down. She wanted a quantifiable way of reaching the community. She
stated that how the outreach is done must be very creative to figure out how
specific populations find this issue relevant. We are being creative to reach
out to these communities she suggested using the Church service as a method of
notification, to include going to services, offering meals and so forth.

Sam Lipson stated that the conversation is just beginning about outreach now
that the CCVA is done, especially how to reach people who are not usually
reached. He stated that the Public Health Department had to get creative with
the types of questions asked and used focus groups to formulate the questions
as was done with the Community Health Assessment. There are existing groups,
such as Baby U, that can also add communications value. He spoke about the
number of people who responded to the survey on line. Climate change
vulnerability reflects are old concerns, not new ones. Being prepared is not
new. He stated that vulnerability, and preparedness, is a household by
household issue as each household has a different set of concerns. It’s about
getting ready for a snowstorm and more. Councillor Simmons spoke about people
participating to keep themselves safe. She stated that this needs to be multi-
lingual and constant, maybe use “Climate Ambassadors” to provide a level of
authenticity. She stated that the City Council may be able to engage more
people to attend these meeting. She spoke about poverty and access to good
food. She asked if there is a correlation that poorer areas are more
vulnerable. Mr. Lipson stated that they are starting to identify resources
communities rely on for flooding and, sometimes, heat risks. Councillor
Simmons asked if asthma was correlated to poverty. Commissioner O'Riordan
responded in the affirmative. Councillor Simmons noted that the City Council
can help provide resources in these key communities. If the eastern part of
the City is more vulnerability, then the community benefit mitigation funds
could be used in those neighborhoods. She also noted that it will be necessary
to make repeat visits to various places at different times.

Councillor Kelley opened the hearing to public comment.

Megan Brooks, 103 Inman Street, stated that she has not read any of the
reports. The general planning should be connected to the City. She stated that
preparing and protecting the environment is bigger than any other issue of the
City. She wanted preparedness put above any other thing in the City. If the
land is overdeveloped it will be harder to prepare for these problems.

Andrea Wilder, 12 Arlington Street, became aware of this 5-6 years ago when
she learned from the Boston Harbor Association that the height of the water
from Boston Harbor would affect the Moakley Steps. She stated that Cambridge
does not know what Boston will be doing. She stated that her concern is the
transportation for the Redline to stay dry and preventing this subway from
becoming a river. She stated that open spaces act like sponges by planting
trees. She would like green space increased with trees that provide shade. She
spoke about building material and shingles used. She stated that CDD and
special permits requirements need to be reviewed and changed to reflect the
reality of climate change to use non-heat sink building materials and so
forth. She spoke about changes in insurance policies that will affect homes
and building and how buildings will have to, like the Spaulding building in
Charlestown, compensate for climate change. She stated that making building
flood proofing should be part of the regulations. She spoke about reviewing
requirements for new buildings and retrofitting old buildings. She suggested
that when distributing information to groups, maps would be a good tool. Ms.
Rasmussen stated that this is what the preparedness plan will consist of. The
CCVA will focus the City to look at the tree canopy and what are the
strategies needed for a new buildings and providing flood proofing.

Jan Devereux, 255 Lakeview Avenue, noted her communications background and
asked what the message is. The PowerPoint is too overwhelming to take to
churches and organizations, it is important not to be too alarmist. She
suggested speaking about events in people's life time and she stated that she
may not be around in 2070. She suggested using 2050. She noted that specifying
risk to specific populations, for example garden apartment dwellers, garbage
collectors, would be useful. She stated that what can be done to lessen this
from happening would be more effective.

Ann Durbin stated that she read the technical part of the report. It is
important that the City address the health issues for infectious disease. She
further stated that outreach should include talking to health practitioners.
She stated that workers who work outside are more vulnerable and that this
should be addressed.

Robert Winters, 366 Broadway, stated that, basically, Alewife is a teacup. He
spoke about the railroad and the inadequate culverts to convey water across.
He spoke about storm drains in the Port and Mid-Cambridge areas. He asked what
absolutely needs to be done. He spoke about the method that was used in
Lowell. He noted that the MBTA’s flood protection plan may have worked had
people understood what they needed to do, but the flashboards were not used
and Kenmore Square flooded. When the report was presented there was a focus on
the loss of power generation. There is a problem in Cambridge with the aging
electrical infrastructure, a “wires in dirt’ power distribution system. It
fails during the highest load. He stated that he did not see this addressed in
the CCVA. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that as we move throughout the plan
the secondary issues such as communications will be addressed but they were
not part of the CCVA. He stated that he agreed with the statement about the
electrical infrastructure. The primary effort is new development and new
projects not upgrading older systems but perhaps the CCVA will help create
leverage to improve more vulnerable existing systems. The Alewife sub-station
is an issue and an RFP has been put out by Eversource. He spoke about
buildings where people can go when there is an emergency. More people are
looking at “islanding.” Ms. Rasmussen stated that low carbon energy study RFP
will be put out next year which may help islanding.

Councillor Kelley commented that this conversation is daunting. How can this
be manageable? This was flooding and heating. What happens when people cannot
go into their building when it is too hot? Low carbon energy RFP is tied to
resiliency. He wanted to know that the 1500 City employees can communicate
about these issues. The schools need to be part of our resiliency disaster
planning. Councillor Carlone spoke about communications being out in a flood.
We do not want to over emphasize the fear.

Mr. Lipson stated that the Public Health Department it is about preparing for
bad news. He spoke about FEMA duct tape instructions being silly but
widespread. Emphasizing evacuation is not practical; keep the message
practical and relevant. This is not new stuff. There are lessons to be learned
from incidents that have occurred. He spoke about the problem with delivering
medicine by the mail during Hurricane Sandy in Hoboken, NJ. The solution was
to have a pharmacist filling prescriptions in City Hall.

Councillor Kelley stated that he does not think that there are two years to
think about instances. Councillor McGovern stated he did not know what an
evacuation plan is. Is there a set plan if there is an emergency and how is
the community notified. Mr. Lipson stated the Red Cross has approved
facilities beforehand in the event of an emergency and that the Fire
Department’s Emergency Planning Committee handles this.

Ms. Durbin asked if the City has its own radio station. She suggested having a
hand cranked radio. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that DPW staff engages with
other departments and lays out the plan, much as happens with snow operations.
Councillor Simmons suggested looking at previous plans.

Megan Brooks stated that universities have enormous resources. She stated that
a crank radio is a good idea. She stated that information should also be in
paper form to all residents.

Ms. Devereux stated that a communication department figures out what message
needs to be sent out and that perhaps less “emergency communications” and more
department communications would be a good idea. Ms. Rasmussen stated that
where the shelters are located are unknown. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that
Lee Gianetti is the Communication Director in the Office of the City Manager
and there are two communication specialist in Public Works. Mr. Lipson stated
that better communication has occurred. He noted that the City’s use of social
media is improving. Commissioner O'Riordan spoke about the snow emergency of
last year and the collaboration between Public Works and the City Manager's
office.

Councillor Kelley stated that if this is the challenge of our times better
communication needs to be done.

Councillor Kelley thanked all those present for their attendance.

The hearing adjourned at 4:34 P.M.

1557,2161," A communication transmitted from Richard C. Rossi, City Manager, relative to the adoption of a Policy Order committing Vision Zero, a set of goals of eliminating transportation fatalities and serious injuries.","For many years, the City of Cambridge has been committed to improving safety
for all users of the transportation system, particularly those users who are
most vulnerable. As part of this commitment, we have undertaken a wide range
of engineering, education, and enforcement efforts aimed at reducing crashes,
increasing respect amongst users, and generally creating a safer and more
equitable transportation network that meets the needs of users of all ages and
all abilities. As a result of these efforts, we have seen an ongoing decrease
in crash rates, as well as a reduction in the number of fatalities and serious
injuries. Nonetheless, even one fatality or serious injury is more than we
want to see, and we are continually seeking out ways to further reduce these
types of incidents, and the pain and suffering they cause to individuals and
our community at large.  
  
In recent years, a number of communities-first in Europe and now increasingly
in the United States-have begun to commit to Vision Zero, which sets a goal of
eliminating transportation fatalities and serious injuries. Vision Zero is
both an aspirational goal and a real goal, and we believe that in a community
like Cambridge, it is in fact feasible to attempt to eliminate these types of
serious incidents, through the types of engineering, education, and
enforcement efforts we are already undertaking, with a particular focus on the
safety of our system. Vision Zero provides a very helpful perspective on how
we improve transportation safety and the actions that we need to take to make
the goal a reality.

&lt;http://www.visionzeronetwork.org&gt;), many communities have already
committed to Vision Zero and have developed action plans that detail how they
plan to achieve the elimination of transportation fatalities and serious
injuries (see the attached map for communities that have committed to Vision
Zero or are considering doing so). The goals and approach associated with
Vision Zero are broadly consistent with our existing approach to
transportation planning, design, and operations, including the following
policies, plans, and programs:  

· The Vehicle Trip Reduction Ordinance

· The Climate Protection Plan

· The Pedestrian Plan

· The Bicycle Plan

· The Transit Strategic Plan

· The Five-Year Street and Sidewalk Reconstruction Plan

· The Community Health Improvement Plan

· The Safe Routes to School Program

· The CitySmart Program

Based on the policies and plans, we do not expect that committing to Vision
Zero will require significant new expenditures. Rather, it will create an
enhanced focus on safety as we look at transportation problems and solutions
through the lens of public health and harm reduction. In recent years, we have
done extensive analysis of crash statistics in Cambridge, which has given much
improved data about safety issues and locations where improvements are needed.
This data will form the basis of our Vision Zero efforts, allowing us to take
a data-driven approach to achieving the Vision Zero goal.

As City Manager, I am prepared to commit to Vision Zero, as are all of the key
City Departments involved in transportation, including Community Development,
Police, Public Health, Public Works, and Traffic, Parking, and Transportation.
I ask that the City Council will join us in this commitment by approving the
attached resolution and demonstrating that the City of Cambridge is fully
committed to eliminating transportation fatalities and serious injuries.

of Chapter 43, Section 14 of Chapter 40, and Chapter 79 of the General Laws,
all as amended, it is provided that the Cambridge City Council may take in fee
in the name of the City for any municipal purpose any land within the limits

Council take the above referenced parcel of land for municipal purposes,

office purposes, and for all uses and purposed accessory thereto.

by the Chief Assessor to cover the estimated pro tanto payment toward the
expenses of acquisition as required by the above referenced Sections of
Chapters 40 and 43 of the General Laws.  
  
Under the law, the property owner has the right to challenge the amount of the
pro tanto payment in a legal proceeding and could seek to persuade a court
that it is entitled to the actual fair market value of the property as well as
certain other statutory damages such as relocation costs. I will initiate a
settlement of any such claim with the property owner if the City Council votes
to approve these two orders and authorizes the taking of this property by
eminent domain. In the event that I successfully reach a proposed settlement
with the property owner to resolve such damages claim, I anticipate returning
to the City Council in the near future with a request for a further
appropriation which would authorize me to settle the claim and would
constitute a final agreed damages award to the Chamber of Commerce to pay for
the taking of this property.

that you may have.

WHEREAS:

A widely documented opioid crisis is affecting the greater Boston area and

The drug Naloxone, also known as Narcan, is an important tool for first
responders in emergency situations involving opioid overdose; and

WHEREAS:

|

Two bills; House Bill 3944, An Act relative to substance use, treatment,
education and prevention and Senate Bill 2022, An Act relative to substance
abuse prevention; are progressing through the Massachusetts State legislature,

effectively address drug addiction, and each includes the following language:
“Any person who, in good faith, attempts to render emergency care by
administering naloxone or any other opioid antagonist as defined in section
19B of chapter 94C to a person reasonably believed to be experiencing an
opiate-related overdoes shall not be liable for acts or omissions, other than
gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct, resulting from the attempt
to render this emergency care.;” and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

Both the House and the Senate find the administration of Narcan in emergency
situations to be of sufficiently high value such that the same language
protecting those administering the drug is included in the language of each
bill; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

Until this language protecting emergency administers of Narcan is codified,
potential legal liability for responders in Cambridge could stand in the way
of administering help to those in medical distress caused by opioids; now

reducing waste generation in the City and meeting the 2020 and 2050 goals of
30% and 80% waste reduction from households.

The first phase of this plan is to ready the City for the expansion Citywide
of the curb-side organics collection program. It is presently expected that
such will occur in the fall of 2017. Beyond that, the City then needs to
consider how to further improve organics collection numbers both in terms of
participation and the amount of material diverted away from the
landfill/incinerator waste stream.

In executing this ambitious program, we also need to be cognizant of how best
to manage rubbish, recycling, yard waste and organics collection,
transportation and the availability of production facilities in the
metropolitan area that can best manage these resources. This appropriation
will assist in addressing these issues.

(VNM) credits to the General Fund Public Works Other Ordinary Maintenance
account to cover invoices related to the VNM agreement for the photovoltaic
project known as “Summer Street Solar.”

The project is set to come on line imminently. Under the agreement the City
will receive monthly checks from Eversource representing the value of the
credits and will pay the solar developer 85% of the credits received. Checks
will be deposited into a revenue account. Due to the timing of the projects
the estimated payments were not included in the FY17 budget.

The City executed this and other virtual net metering agreements as part of
the strategy our energy broker recommended to help finance the procurement of
100% renewable energy.

Background

The 2008 Massachusetts Green Communities Act created incentives for solar
developers to work with municipal entities to develop projects. The
municipality executes an agreement with a solar developer to purchase the
entire output of a commercial scale solar array at a set price per kWh and
then effectively sells the entire output of the array to the utility in return
for net metering credits equal to a higher price per kWh.

The City has signed five VNM contracts for close to 6 megawatts of solar,
including, most recently, rooftop arrays at Alewife MBTA and the route 128
MBTA facility in Westwood.

The Finance Committee, comprised of the entire membership of the City Council,
conducted a public hearing on March 3, 2016 at 5:06 PM in the Ackermann Room.

The purpose of the hearing was to discuss the FY 16 budget and the FY 17
budget process. Vice Mayor McGovern announced that the meeting is being
privately audio recorded.

Present at the hearing were Vice Mayor McGovern, Chair of the Committee,

Councillor Carlone, Councillor Cheung, Councillor Kelley, Councillor Maher,
Councillor Mazen, Councillor Toomey, Mayor Simmons, City Manager Richard
Rossi, Deputy City Manager Lisa Peterson, Assistant City Manager for Fiscal
Affairs Louis DePasquale, Ellen Semonoff, Assistant City Manager for Human

Relations and City Clerk Donna P. Lopez.

Also present were John Hawkinson, 84 Massachusetts Avenue and Hasson Rashid,
820 Massachusetts Avenue.

Vice Mayor McGovern opened the hearing and explained the purpose. The meeting
was the result of Policy Order # 9 dated January 25, 2016 (ATTACHMENT A) to
discuss goals as they relate to the current budget and the FY17 budget.

City Manager Rossi spoke about the FY16 budget as it rolls into FY17 budget.
He stated that the preparation of the budget is a top priority for a city
manager as it affects the entire City. He explained that 80% of the budget
costs are fixed costs which is where the budget starts from. It is no secret
that Cambridge has high property values. All the departmental initiatives grow
the budget in a positive way. Policy related issues are taken into
consideration as well as the state budget. The budget process takes twelve
months. Mr. Rossi stated that in Cambridge the budget is incredible. The
police, fire and human services provided in the City has come about as joint
effort with the city manager, city departments and the community.

Councillor Cheung noted that City Council committees have goal setting
meetings. What is the goal of this meeting? Councillor Carlone stated that
because goals were not set last term the budget is not affected. Councillor
Cheung stated that he had meetings to develop goals for his committees and
they roll up into the Government Operations, Rules and Claims Committee.

Mr. Rossi explained the process. He stated that the City Manager is
responsible for preparing the budget and is impacted in many ways. A goal
setting exercised is needed between the City Council and the City Manager. He
stated that goals need to be broad but tell the story of where the City wants
to go.

Vice Mayor McGovern gave an example. He is interested in having a shower bus
for the homeless and would love for Cambridge to have this. Where does he go
for this to be in the budget? Mr. Rossi explained that this is the type of
thing that the City Manager and his team determine how this will be done. He
cannot prepare a budget on the requests of nine different people; he cannot
fund everyone's great ideas. Councillor Cheung explained his request for more
money and governance for the IT budget; which took multiple years and this
translated into budgetary money. Mr. Rossi stated that this needed a bigger
process and this budget was increased over a long term process.

Councillor Mazen stated that the whole finance-City Manager team does a great
job to provide a budget package. He spoke about balance between specificity
and implementation. Mr. Rossi stated that from a policy point of view
initiatives will come out in the committee process rather than by a policy
order. The IT process was a more public facing process. Councillor Mazen noted
that two major factors of the budget process that will indicate success. They
are the latitude to cut spending based on discussions with the City Council to
make some fiscal decision moving forward and the other is that the City
Council would come together to establish projects which may not be a priority
and to take a consensus list to give guidance to the City Manager. Mr. Rossi
stated that in the end that he has to make a decision. He added that the
personnel who run the city departments are the experts and he makes his budget
based on this input and on the input of the City Council. Councillor Mazen
stated that if this is done as package the City Manager can tell what can be
done on this list. Mr. Rossi stated that this budget meets the needs of the
community.

Vice Mayor McGovern commented that when Plan E is questioned the system works
because of the checks and balances in place. He asked how can the City Council
have an impact and have input into the budget process. Mr. Rossi responded
that the majority of the increase in the city budget comes from the City
Council. He stated that the needs of the community are great.

Councillor Carlone stated that he felt frustrated by the budget process. The
City Council had little input. There is a 5-10 year plan and fixed costs due
to salaries. He stated that more money needs to be put into affordable housing
and that the childcare strategy makes sense. The City Council general goals is
what the budget is based on and they are not very objective. Mr. Rossi noted
that this is within the City Council's purview. This makes it easier for the
City Manager to interpret. He explained that the City Manager has to have a
balanced budget, fill the needs and protect the City. The City Council's
responsibility is to adopt and approve the budget. The City Council can reject
the budget or add to the budget. Councillor Carlone asked if the City Council
is really involved in the budget process. He wanted a list of infrastructure
project or housing projects so that he can digest this information. Mr. Rossi
stated that the City Council is underestimating what impact the City Council
has in the budgetary process.

Councillor Cheung stated that this debate is around the micro versus the macro
issues. The City Council has to ensure that the City Manager is hiring
competent employees. All the micro issues will wipe out the macro issues. Mr.
Rossi spoke about a Policy Order that requires a study and the amount of work
and time that is spent on unreal issues. He spoke about the time drain on
employees is hard on everyone. Councillor Cheung noted that macro stuff is
being done well. He explained that he asked how to effect the IT budget and
that he followed the instructions given by the City Manager. The City Charter
is set up to limit the power of the City Council and the City Council has
diluted power and there is currently more transparency.

Vice Mayor McGovern applauded the City staff and employees who work for the
city. He added that the City Council has to be respectful of the City
Manager's time and it is hard for an elected official to respond to a
constituent that they cannot help them. Mr. Rossi explained that things that
are not feasible may not go forward.

Councillor Mazen stated that the productive tension is the balance of what is
appropriate. The process needs flexibility and needs input from the City
Council. The City Council can get behind the budget and he wanted more leeway
to create a budget that all are happy with. City Manager Rossi stated that
this is not the way it works. It is his responsibility to prepare a budget.
Councillor Mazen suggested that the preparation of the budget with City
Council input may cause delay. Mr. Rossi stated that the City Council input is
in the goal setting session. He stated that the laws on the budget must be
read; they are written to protect the public. He cautioned about the loss of
state aid. Councillor Mazen wanted consensus building so that there is input
into the budget and asked how the goal setting sessions make their way into
the budget process. Councillor Cheung informed the committee that he wanted
participatory budgeting and there was a Finance Committee hearing and now
Cambridge has participatory budgeting.

Councillor Carlone stated that his frustration is that the goal setting
process was unproductive. Mr. Rossi stated that for goal setting process the
city will hire a consultant to hear what the City Council wants and then the
consultant will have a feeling of how things were done.

Vice Mayor McGovern stated that the School Department has guidelines which
lists the values that have to be in the budget. Mr. Rossi stated that this is
done on a departmental level all the time. Vice Mayor McGovern asked if it
would be more helpful if the City Council meet and listed things they wanted
in the budget. Councillor Carlone stated that he wanted more clarity on the
impact. Councillor Mazen wanted to make the process easier with less pain.

Vice Mayor McGovern stated that Cambridge is in the envy of all other
communities.

Councillor Cheung stated that he does not want to hire a consultant. The City
Council can have committee hearings and report out overarching goals.
Councillor Mazen stated that doing this in committees has too many moving
parts. Councillor Cheung noted that there has been consistency in finding
money in the budget for emergency needs.

Mr. Rossi explained the process when an idea is brought to him. Councillor
Carlone spoke about City Council consensus. Mr. Rossi stated it is a good
idea; but it is one on a list of good ideas. Councillor Mazen spoke about
developing a patter for the City Council on what works and does not work.
These discussion need to be before the City Council.

At this time Assistant City Manager for Fiscal Affairs, Mr. DePasquale, gave
an update on the FY 16. He stated that the City Council is not giving
themselves credit for the impact the City Council has on the budget. The
budget process development takes a lot of time. The budget has grown 25
positions and it will increase in FY17. Mr. Rossi stated that this is due to
the increase in programing. Mitigation funds has been purposed in the
community and the money is helping nonprofits. Mr. Rossi stated that he is
hearing that early childcare is only a City issue and he wanted the City
Council to respond to this comment when they meet with the School Committee.
He spoke about the City initiatives created by the City Council: such as
STEAM, vulnerability assessment and early childcare.

Public Works Commissioner O'Riordan stated that there was a capital meeting
held on street reconstruction. For FY15 $8 million was allocated; this year $4
million is allocated. He stated that in FY15 budget hearing heard about the
problem of tree wells and money was put into budget to deal with this as well
as funding for truck barriers; street clean and recycling. Mr. Rossi added
that Net Zero is a big cost to the City.

Ms. Semonoff stated that second position was added DHSP for civic engagement.
Funding was expanded for legal services for eviction protection and for food
pantries. She stated that Baby U was created from a request from the City
Council; transitional jobs program was also grown from a City Council request.

Commissioner Haas spoke about providing services for the most vulnerable and
this is done by collaboration with many City departments. He stated that the
work with youth has shown that there is a decrease in juvenile arrest. He
spoke about the work with the elderly. Police work has been acknowledged
nationally. He explained that 93.8% of his budget is salaries. He has two
social workers on staff; this is not seen in other police departments. We are
building and working towards a healthier community.

Mr. Rossi spoke about the Law Department budget working to provide better
process on enforcement. He added that the City Clerk's has a great computer
system and will be an advanced City Clerk's Office in the years to come.

Assistant City Manager for Community Development, Iram Farooq, spoke about the
$3.3 million allocated for planning. The Net Zero process impact on the budget
is a 25 year plan. The City Council has prioritized Planning Board
improvements; funding for urban design and traffic analysis. She stated that
the Planning Board will begin streaming their meetings. There have been
updates to the inclusionary zoning; regional engagement; Mayors Compact, etc.,
Hubway; bike network planning and bike racks. Mr. Rossi stated that no public
project is created without input from the City Council. He stated that the
City Council's fingerprints are all over the budget. This is a partnership and
a clear City Council message helps the administration to implement.

Mr. DePasquale stated that 98% of property tax bills are paid on time and the
City is at 99% to date. Last year there was a 16.28% increase in residential
value. He spoke about the small number of application for abatements. He
explained that revenue is coming in strong. Departmental budgets are in good
shape. Budget issue this year is snow expenditure of $600,000 over what was
appropriated. The expenditure is generally around $2 million. He stated that
the School Department has a projected $500,000 - $700,000 deficit. These items
will come to the City Council for a supplemental appropriation. Mr. Rossi
stated that the benefit level for employees has changed due to City Council
input. Mr. DePasquale stated that there is a $1-2 million surplus in salaries;
health insurance has a surplus with a zero increase. Mr. Rossi stated that
free cash should never be spent down; it is the City's insurance policy

Mr. DePasquale gave an overview of FY17 budget. The School Department has the
biggest gap; and the gap is closing without affecting the students. There is a
5.5% projected tax levy increase at the start of the process for FY17. He
spoke about the modest tax levy increase. Water rates have had a zero increase
for 5-6 years; sewer rates a 3.2% increase and it may go up greater this year.
City is growing and the City needs to keep an eye on the budget and property
tax increases.

Councillor Carlone thanked Vice Mayor McGovern for convening this hearing.
Vice Mayor McGovern added that he will have a hearing on the goals.

At 6:29 PM Vice Mayor McGovern opened the hearing to public comment.

Mr. Rashid stated that there is not enough money in the budget for the
homeless.

At 6:30 PM public comment was closed.

Councillor Cheung encouraged the City Manager to have the City Council
committees hold hearings on the goals. He suggested having ideas held in a
holding meeting for all new ideas.

Vice Mayor McGovern stated that after the Roundtable/working meeting with the
School Committee on March 28, 2016 he wanted to hold smaller hearings with the
City Council and the School Committee to have questions answered before the
budget hearing so that the budget hearing is on budget items rather than
curriculum issues. Mr. Rossi stated that departments are already executing
their plan and when the City Council throws another program in it is
difficult.

Councillor Mazen stated that it is important to address homelessness. It is
unfair to say that nothing is done and that government does not have the
amount of resources to address this issue. He stated that the problem is
large. Vice Mayor McGovern spoke about the departmental services that have
helped homelessness.

Vice Mayor McGovern thanked all attendees.

The hearing adjourned at 6:39 PM. on a motion by Councillor Cheung. .

Committee (CPAC) for FY2017. For additional information, please see
attachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Lisa Peterson, dated September 19,
2016.  
  
The CPA process began with a public meeting held on June 15, 2016, to solicit
suggestions on CPA projects for FY2017. Based on that meeting and other
inputs, the CPAC was provided information on project funding requests without
any recommendations for percentage allocations of anticipated CPA funds. A
public hearing was held on July 28, 2016, to solicit recommendations from the
public on percentage allocations. The CPAC also received several petitions,
letters and e-mails along with online project requests from the public
relative to CPA recommendations. The CPAC, on September 7, 2016, unanimously
voted for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historical
Preservation Projects and 10% for Open Space Projects.  
  
In accordance with the CPAC’s recommendations, I am requesting that the City
Council appropriate a total of $12,310,000 in CPA funds raised by the City's
FY2017 CPA surcharge, the FY2016 state match funds received in FY2017 and a
portion of the existing CPA fund balance.  
  
For this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the
CPA surcharge for FY2017 will total $8,600,000, with an additional state match
of approximately $1,600,000. In addition, $2,100,000 from CPA Fund Balance is
being recommended for appropriation, plus an additional $10,000 from the Fund
Balance for annual membership dues to the Community Preservation Coalition.  
  
On September 7, 2016, the CPAC made recommendations for allocation of these
FY2017 funds. By unanimous votes, the CPAC recommended to the City Council,
through the City Manager, that the CPA funds be allocated and appropriated as
follows:

Hazard Mitigation Plan and Policy Order. This update was prepared with staff
and community input and has been reviewed and approved by the Massachusetts
Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA). The plan was funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s
(FEMA) Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) Grant Program.

Planning for the Cambridge Hazard Mitigation Plan 2015 Update was led by the
Cambridge Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee. This committee discussed
where the impacts of natural hazards most affect the City, goals for
addressing these impacts, and hazard mitigation measures that would benefit
the City.

The Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 requires all municipalities that
wish to be eligible to receive FEMA funding for hazard mitigation grants, to
adopt a local multi-hazard mitigation plan and update this plan in five year
intervals.

Natural hazard mitigation planning is the process of determining how to
systematically reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property damage
resulting from natural hazards such as floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes
through long-term strategies. These long-term strategies include planning,
policy changes, programs, projects, and other activities.

Flooding, driven by hurricanes, northeasters, and other storms, clearly
presents the greatest hazard to the City of Cambridge, most especially in
locations that are low-lying or where drainage and conveyance systems can be
overwhelmed during storm events with significant precipitation.

General Fund Community Development Other Ordinance Maintenance account to
complete a community-wide Greenhouse gas inventory.

As a signatory to the Compact of Mayors, the City has committed to completing
an inventory of community wide greenhouse gas emissions using the Global
Protocol for Community Wide Emissions. The Compact of Mayors is the world’s
largest coalition of city leaders addressing climate change by pledging to
reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, tracking their progress and preparing
for the impacts of climate change.  
  
The community wide greenhouse gas emissions inventory will advance the City’s
efforts to reduce and manage climate change impacts in addition to fulfilling
the commitments the City has made as a signatory of the Compact of Mayors. The
inventory provides the necessary foundation and baseline that enables setting
greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, engaging specific sectors in
actions to reduce emissions, developing a plan to reduce emissions, and
tracking the community’s progress towards the emission reduction targets.  
  
The Environmental and Transportation Planning Division will hire and manage a
consultant to complete the following tasks by the end of 2016:  
  
Develop a methodology for Cambridge’s community-wide greenhouse gas inventory.

The inventory methodology should meet both the Global Protocol for Community
Wide Emissions and the City’s criteria for internal planning purposes.

Set a baseline year and identify the most robust, reliable and accurate
activity data available to the City for the purpose of calculating emissions.

Where City specific data is not available, develop scaling factors to account
for the City’s portion of emissions.

Complete a community-wide greenhouse gas inventory

The inventory will include all stationary energy use, transportation emissions
occurring within the boundaries of the City, and emissions from waste
(including wastewater) disposed of outside City boundaries.

The inventory will be completed for a baseline year and one interim year,
providing a trend line for greenhouse gas emissions.

  
Forecast future emissions for a target year

Future greenhouse gas emissions using a business as usual scenario will be
forecast to provide another point of reference for GHG reductions.

  
Create a community-wide inventory report

The report will meet the requirements of the Global Protocol for Community
Wide Protocol, reporting emissions by Scope, Sector, Sub-Sector and Fuel Type.
It will use text and graphics to describe the methodology and findings of the
analysis. The report will identify top-priority sources of GHG emissions for
which reductions strategies will be developed in later phases of Cambridge’s
climate change planning process.

in Kendall Square with the residents of public housing as well as others in
the neighborhood formerly known as Area 4. This has resulted in efforts led by
youth and adults to highlight the stories of the residents of the neighborhood
and to demonstrate those stories through public art in the neighborhood.

The City will contract with the Community Arts Center for the third phase of
the Port Stories Art Project designed to publicize and promote the renaming of
the area as the Port as voted by the City Council. Through pop-up events,
photographic documentation, story collection, and neighborhood brand
development, the youth and staff of the community art center will lead a year-

operators of the Hubway bike share system will expire. Through a Request for
Proposal (“RFP”) process, administered by the Metropolitan Area Planning
Council (“MAPC”), on behalf of the City as well as the Cities of Boston and
Somerville and the Town of Brookline, Motivate was designated as the
Successful Bidder. All city and town leaders have been working assiduously on
negotiating a new contract with Motivate.

Due to the complex nature of the contract it is possible that the new contract
will not be executed by the expiration date of the existing contract. We
expect that this process will be completed by the end of April or beginning of
May, 2017. Therefore, to avoid any lapse in the bike share system it is
necessary to extend the current contract for up to three (3) months beyond the
original term of the contract pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter
30(B).

I therefore hereby request that the City Council authorize the Purchasing
Agent to award an extension to the existing contract with Motivate, for up to
three (3) months, in order to allow the system to operate without interruption
and to enable the City to secure an advantageous contract.

1568,2859," A communication transmitted from Richard C. Rossi, City Manager, relative to a report on the continued progress on the application for funding under the Commonwealth’s Infrastructure Investment Incentive Program (I-Cubed) for the North Point area of the City.","I am pleased to report that the City of Cambridge is continuing to make
progress on the application for funding under the Commonwealth’s
Infrastructure Investment Incentive Program (I-Cubed) for the North Point area
of the City.  
  
In order to move towards final approval from the Commonwealth, I am requesting
City Council approval of three orders related to the I-Cubed program which are
summarized below, and detailed in the Order attached:  

1\. Approval of the North Point Economic Development Proposal and the
provision of Local Infrastructure Development Assistance;

2\. Approval for the creation, by the City, of a Municipal Liquidity Reserve
for each Assessment Parcel to be funded by moneys or a letter of credit to be
provided by the owner of each Assessment Parcel;

3\. Approval of the acquisition or acceptance by the City of such property
interests in the North Point Public Infrastructure Improvements that are
financed by MassDevelopment as may be required under the I-Cubed Program,
subject to provisions of the Infrastructure MOA.

  
Since 2013, the City has been involved in this collaborative process, which
leverages the strong development climate in the city, and will fund vital
infrastructure improvements for the area as well as provide long term benefits
to the City.  
  
The I-Cubed program provides a mechanism for funding public infrastructure
associated with economic development projects. It relies on new state tax
revenues derived primarily from new jobs associated with the project to pay
debt service on the bonds, which are issued by the Commonwealth to fund the
infrastructure. The State issues the bonds only after establishing that new
state tax revenues will support the debt service. The application requests $25
million in State funding (half of the maximum amount allowed for any
development project under the program) to be used to support a portion of the
approximately $78 million in aggregate investment by the applicants in public
infrastructure improvements in and around North Point.  
  
As part of this process, City is required to hold a public hearing regarding
the North Point I-Cubed proposal. A public hearing took place on Tuesday, June
14, 2016 at 7:00 pm at the Citywide Senior Center.  
  
Below is a summary of what was presented at the hearing:  
  
Richard Rossi, City Manager for the City of Cambridge, opened the hearing by
providing an overview of the I-Cubed process. He noted that the City has been
closely examining this program since 2013 in terms of value and associated
risks. The North Point I-Cubed proposal is a joint effort by and among EF
Education First, the North Point Development Team, the City of Cambridge, and
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  
  
Several City departments have been actively involved in this process
including: the City Manager’s Office, City Solicitor, Finance Department, City
Assessor, Community Development Department, Purchasing Agent, the Traffic,
Parking and Transportation Department and the Department of Public Works. In
January 2014, the City retained First Southwest, a financial consultant, and
Locke Lord LLP, outside counsel, to work with City officials to analyze the
benefits and potential risk to the City. The City also retained Anderson &amp;
Kreiger as outside counsel to assist in drafting and negotiating agreements
with the North Point developer regarding the infrastructure improvements to be
made as part of the I-Cubed process.  
  
Representatives from EF Education First and the North Point Development Team
presented on the importance and benefits of the program to their plans for
growth in the area. They also provided a summary of the changes and
significant private investment that has occurred in North Point in recent
years. It was explained that all parties involved up to this point have strong
confidence in the revenue projections associated with the new developments and
financial assumptions used in analyzing the program.  
  
Susanne Rasmussen, Director of Environment and Transportation Planning in the
Community Development Department, talked about some of the important community
benefits that will be gained through the infrastructure improvements: A new
internal roadway network that emphasizes walking and biking and accommodates
transit use, shortened distance to the Community College MBTA station through
a new pedestrian link; ability to accommodate a new Lechmere MBTA Station,
facilitating the conversion of automobile trips to transit trips for both
commuting and all other trip purposes to North Point, the Kendall Square area,
downtown Boston, and other locations along the Green Line; enhanced bicycle
and pedestrian connections to the river as well as the wider regional pathway
network; reconstruction of Monsignor O’Brien Highway which will provide new,
safer, pedestrian crossings connecting East Cambridge, Kendall Square and
North Point, and allow for improved bike mobility through new grade-separated
cycle tracks along the road; and the extension of First Street to Monsignor
O’Brien Highway which will facilitate shifting the burden of automobile
traffic between Kendall Square and points north from Third Street onto First
Street, which is more commercial in character.  
  
Louis DePasquale, Assistant City Manager for Fiscal Affairs in the City of
Cambridge, reviewed financial implications and benefits of the project. He
noted that the I-Cubed regulations are set up in a way that allow appropriate
oversight and protections for the City and reminded the group that neither
City property taxes, nor City bonds, are used to finance the program. He
restated confidence in the projections used, and noted that when the
cumulative revenues exceed the outstanding principal and accrued interest on
the Bonds, the City’s contingent obligation ends. He shared that this is
currently projected to happen as early as 2023. Robert Reardon, City Assessor
for the City of Cambridge, added that an Assessment Plan is required by I
-Cubed regulations and that the City is allowed to assess certain North Point
properties in the unlikely event of any shortfall in sales and income tax
revenue, which provides additional protections for the City.  
  
There were no comments from the public at this hearing, but it should be noted
that presentations have been made to the East Cambridge Planning Team, and we
look forward to final approval by the City Council.  
  
I strongly believe that this is an exceptional opportunity for the City. As
proposed, there is minimal financial risk or cost to the City, and the funding
will allow for key infrastructure improvements that are not only important in
realizing the comprehensive vision for this area, but also result in
significant long term benefits for the entire City.

1557,2166," A communication transmitted from Richard C. Rossi, City Manager, relative to the block rates for water consumption and sewer use for the period beginning April 1, 2016 and ending March 31, 2017.","RECOMMENDATIONS

The City administration and City Council continue to recognize the importance
of minimizing increases in water and sewer rates. I recommend that the City
Council approve a 0% increase in the water consumption block rate and a 3.2%
increase in the sewer use block rate, resulting in a 2.4% increase in the
combined rate for the period beginning April 1, 2016 and ending March 31,
2017. This is the sixth consecutive year that the City has been able to
produce a 0% increase in the water rate.  
  
In last year’s recommendation, the projected FY17 rate increases for water,
sewer, and combined were 3.1%, 7.7%, and 6.4%, respectively, based on March
2015 consumption rates and projected budgets. We have been able to produce
rates lower than estimated due primarily to lower operating budget projections
in the Water Budget, and lower projected Massachusetts Water Resources
Authority (MWRA) assessments in the Sewer Budget. The MWRA provides annual
updates to their projected assessments.  
  
In March of each year, the City Council establishes water and sewer rates,
which determine water and sewer revenues for the next fiscal year. Because of
the timing requirements, water and sewer rates are set prior to the adoption
of both the Cambridge budget and MWRA budget; therefore, revenue needs are
based upon estimated expenditures. Historically, water and sewer rates have
been established so that revenues generated by them, when combined with other
related revenue sources, cover projected annual costs.

WATER

Two major factors determine the rate necessary to generate sufficient
revenues: water consumption and the budget. The total FY17 Water Budget
reflects a $108,815 increase from FY16. Water is able to offset costs related
to cost-of-living allowances, pensions, and health benefits in the salaries
and wages portion of the operating budget with a decrease in debt service
payments.

The planned FY17 capital allocation is $5,000,000 using pay-as-you-go capital
funding based on current revenues ($3,500,000) and fund balance ($1,500,000).
The major project in the FY17 budget is the second phase of the installation
of variable frequency drives (VFDs) to the raw water pump system. An
additional $1,000,000 million has been included for the replacement of
existing VFDs on the finished water pumps. Installation of the VFDs will
substantially improve energy efficiency at the water treatment plant. The
total project cost is $5,000,000 over two years, of which $3,000,000 was
funded from fund balance. The remainder of the FY17 capital allocation will be
used for improvements to the distribution and transmission system, treatment
plant equipment replacement, consulting services, and improvements to the
watershed. Table 4 on page 5 indicates the details of water fund projected
revenues and expenditures for FY16-21. Table 7 on page 8 shows actual water
fund balances for FY11-15 and the projected balance for FY16.  
  
To support a 0% water rate increase for the sixth year, $350,000 from fund
balance will be used in FY17, bringing the total fund balance used to
$1,850,000. We expect to eliminate the use of the fund balance in FY18, as
decreases in debt service continue and as long as water consumption remains
constant.  
  

Water and sewer charges are directly linked to water consumption, with sewer
costs comprising approximately 71.2% of total water and sewer expenditures.
When consumption declines, revenues are negatively impacted. In the current
fiscal year, water is being consumed at a rate similar to the previous fiscal
year. If this trend continues, this would be the second year in which
consumption has not decreased.

####

#### SEWER

The FY17 sewer budget reflects a 6.0% increase from FY16. This includes the
MWRA assessment, debt service payments, and the sewer component of the Public
Works budget. Debt service on sewer bonds and the MWRA assessment account for
90.2% of the total Sewer Budget.  
  
FY17 estimated sewer revenues will cover the FY17 estimated MWRA assessment,
which is scheduled to increase by $639,184 from the FY16 final assessment. The
MWRA rate increase projected for the City is subject to change based on the
MWRA budget, which is adopted later in spring 2016. These changes have
typically been minor in past years. Unlike the water budget, sewer revenues
are credited to the general fund and not to a separate proprietary fund that
can be drawn upon if the need arises.  
  
Included in the sewer budget are debt service increases attributable to the
$12,740,000 general obligation bonds issued in February 2016 and the February
2016 SRF loan for Concord Avenue for $14,000,000.  
  
The following sewer projects were included in the February 2016 bond issue:
Cherry Street / South Massachusetts Avenue; Alewife Watershed; and Harvard
Square projects.  
  
The FY17 capital allotment of $1,000,000 in sewer revenues will continue to
finance the remedial reconstruction program and development.  
  
The City Council has authorized significant investments in the water and sewer
systems to ensure Cambridge continues to benefit from a healthy and
environmentally sound water and sewer system. In addition to the projects
currently under way, the City’s five-year capital plan (FY17-21) calls for an
additional investment of approximately $135,663,000 (primarily sewer,
$114,663,000) in the water and sewer systems. The City carefully monitors the
issuance of debt to fund authorized sewer projects and makes adjustments to
ensure that debt service cost increases, which impact the sewer rate, are
moderate.  
  
Subsidies from the SRF loan program will cover only $44,240 or 0.2% of the
total debt service of $19,942,737 for all FY17 sewer projects. The City will
continue to receive state subsidies on existing debt. The FY18-21 capital plan
includes other projects that may be eligible for subsidized loans from the
state. As in past years, it is not certain that these projects will receive
state subsidies and the debt service on these projects has been calculated
based on funding through general obligation bonds. If state subsidies become
available to the City, they will be used to lower the sewer rate in future
years. Table 5 on page 6 shows the detail of sewer-related expenditures and
revenues for FY16-21.

# SENIOR DISCOUNT PROGRAM

There are currently 2,620 homeowners who qualify for the age 65+ water/sewer
15% discount (not to exceed $90 annually), which is not tied to the
homeowner’s income.

There are also 80 elderly homeowners who qualify for an income-based discount
of 30% (not to exceed $180 annually). To qualify for the 30% discount, a
homeowner must be 65 or older and must have been granted the Clause 41C
elderly real estate exemption. For FY16, the income guidelines are as follows:
single, income of $25,197 with assets of $50,392 or less; married, income of
$37,796 with assets of $69,289 or less.

# FUTURE OUTLOOK FOR RATES

Overall, the City has been extremely successful over the past five years in
producing minimal water and sewer rate increases. The average annual increases
for the FY12-16 period were as follows: water, 0.0%; sewer, 3.2%; and
combined, 2.3%, which include both the water and sewer rates showing 0%
increases in FY12 and FY13. The FY14, FY15 and FY16 water rate increase was
also 0%.

Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7 contain five-year forecasts for water, sewer, and
combined revenue estimates as well as water fund balances for the past five
years and the projected FY16 fund balance. Although the City currently does
not project the use of fund balance in the out years, it will continue to
review appropriate use of fund balance for a specific project, or to lower the
rate. As can be seen in Table 6, the annual combined water / sewer rate is
projected to increase by an average of approximately 5.2% for FY17-21. The
projected increase is the result of the City’s commitment to bonding sewer
infrastructure improvement projects and increases in the MWRA assessment
(based on estimates received from the MWRA). MWRA increases are projected to
be 1.4% - 7.1% in FY17-FY21. If increases in the MWRA assessment are more
moderate, the rate increases that are shown will be lowered. If consumption
increases and therefore revenues increase, rate increases will be affected
positively. Conversely, if consumption decreases, there will be a negative
effect on water and sewer revenues.

Our water and sewer program is structured to produce reasonable rate increases
in the future. The goal of the City Administration and City Council is to
minimize the effects of water and sewer rate increases on residents as much as
possible, while continuing to invest in our infrastructure.

Public Investment Fund Public Works Department Extraordinary Expenditures
Account to be used to conduct geotechnical, and environmental services to
support the site assessment for a Concept Plan to site the new school on
Callahan Field and future Feasibility Study for the Tobin School project.  
  
The existing school and playing fields were built over what was originally a
clay pit that was mined for a brick manufacturing facility and operation
ceased in the early 1900’s. The site was also a landfill prior to the school
and ballfield use. The Tobin School property currently has an activity and use
limitation (AUL) which allows continued normal use of the school building and
grounds, but restricts access to the soil and groundwater beneath the site at
depths greater than three feet below ground surface.  
  
As part of the process to redevelop the Tobin and Vassal Lane Upper Schools, a
Concept Plan of a school layout shall be performed to assess if it is possible
to construct a new school campus over the current Callahan Field immediately
adjacent to the existing school building, along Concord Avenue. If located on
the field this construction would take place while the Tobin School is in use.
No decisions have been made on this option, however geotechnical and
environment services are required to evaluate both siting options. These
services will provide data to for future designer (architect) to evaluate both
site options during a future Feasibility Study.  
  
Generally, data will be collected by drilling test borings at key locations on
the site, and shall include installation of groundwater monitoring wells to
characterize and evaluate impacted groundwater and to establish seasonal water
elevation fluctuations. Environmental soil and groundwater analytical samples
will be collected to evaluate the challenges of removal and/or capping of
waste materials, and to evaluate how to remediate groundwater issues related
to vapor intrusion during active construction and dewatering activities. It is
anticipated that work will be completed by mid-year 2018.  

  
This work is required to move the Tobin School project forward. By having
complete geotechnical and environmental information, it will allow the City to
make informed decisions on all possible building options for the site.

P. Maher,

Councillor Marc C. McGovern, Councillor E. Denise Simmons, Councillor Timothy
J. Toomey, Jr., Jeff Roberts, Zoning and Land Use Planner, Community

Street and Stephen Kaiser, 191 Hamilton Street.

Vice Mayor Benzan convened the hearing and explained the purpose and stated
that the hearing is being audio and visually recorded.

The petitioner, Patrick Barrett, gave a presentation (ATTACHMENT B). He stated
that the public process was limited and this petition came about after
discussions with the community and his neighbors. He explained that this
petition began two years ago. He stated that basement apartments are low
hanging fruit. He stated that families are faced with difficult decisions of
being over or under-housed. If the petition is adopted as written, housing
units will be created. He stated that the current zoning has accessory
housing. He stated that the City is constantly looking to increase housing.
This is done by density. He stated that the Harvard Defense Fund submitted a
similar petition previously. He stated that there is a significant housing for
large houses. Opportunities across the City can be found to create accessory
uses. A variance is currently required to do this. He stated that the Master
Plan for the City and none of the studies will say less housing is needed. The
Master Plan wants to preserve the neighborhoods. He had a list of amendments.
He stated that the Planning Board had difficulty distinguishing two family
houses to allow this. The two family caveat is eliminated. This may be
something for the Master Plan to decide. The proposed changes are outlined in
the maps (ATTACHMENT C-1 - C-3); the red are additional units; 1007 additional
units will be created without changing the contextual, construction of what is
existing. He stated that Part A and Part B effects both sides of the City.
This amendment should be used as a tool. He discussed areas that were issues
for the Planning Board. He did not want to create an administrative burden and
he suggested eliminating the affidavit provision. The last portion refers to
Part A. He stated that there is no long term effect on neighborhoods and
parking which were concerns for residents and the Planning Board. The map
shows where accessory units will be allowed. He eliminated the requirement for
parking for accessory units because a special permit is required for parking.
This purpose of this petition was to create homes and give flexibility to
homeowners. This petition gives something to homeowners. He stated that a
suggested amendment is that parking is added and could be eliminated by a
special permit. He stated that Part B eliminates GFA space above six feet for
a single or two family homes by as of right or special permit. He noted that
many basements have illegal uses. He stated that the Building, Sanitary and
Municipal Ordinance do not line up. He stated that under the Building Code
currently in a single or two family home it allowed finishing off a basement
at 6'8"" or greater. Depending on the FAR a variance or special permit may be
required. He is suggesting that for single and two family homes it is allowed.
He is trying to create parity. He stated that in the Sanitary Code spaces that
are 6'11"" or lower are not livable or habitable. The Municipal Ordinance lines
up with 6""11"" GFA. He stated that eliminating height in basement units does
not make sense. He stated that there are many units that are unknown by ISD or
the Fire Department that are not up to code and are potential hazards. This
creates underground units. He asked for allowance for people to use these
spaces and bring them up to code. He stated that the biggest issue is flooding
and there are areas in the City where this cannot be done, but this will still
be an issue for a 6'11"" basement. He included that this should be allowed in
large commercial spaces. He stated that he owns the property where Toscanni's
is located and has used basement space for 30 years and now it is a kitchen.
He noted that basement spaces are being used. He stated that if the City is
looking to find creative ways to use space to rezone a large are to allow
additional structure there is already existing basement space that can be
used. He suggested in his amendment that the special permit provision be
eliminated. He stated that there are open space, set back and height
requirements that prevent building throughout the City. These will still
control what is able to be used and Article 8 would still apply. This is a way
to create parity for a proposal that has not received support over the years.
He explained part B. He stated let us use this space, know where these spaces
are, what they are being used for and tax the property. We are taking existing
space and use it more effectively, preserve the neighborhood, and help
families.

Jeff Roberts noted that the Planning Board heard this petition on October 27,
2015 and recommended that the petition needed further study. An advance copy
of the Planning Board recommendation which will be on the agenda for the
November 23rd City Council was distributed (ATTACHMENT D). Mr. Roberts stated
that the Planning Board felt that there were some good points to the petition
such as using the existing housing stock with more flexibility, but felt that
there were aspect of the proposal that needed further study. Accessory units
operate in a full set of zoning requirements and development controls and that
the challenge be looked at in a comprehensive way and be considered in the
city-wide process and establish goals and objectives.

Councillor McGovern asked if the amendments submitted last night to the City
Council address the Planning Board concerns. Mr. Roberts stated that this is
the first time he has seen proposed changes and cannot comment.

Vice Mayor Benzan opened public comment at 2:46 PM.

Marilee Meyer, 10 Dana Street stated that she was lost in the details. Her
impression is that the petition is a city-wide up zoning for properties that
may or may not be appropriate. The Planning Board stated that this is not
ready for prime time and is not directed at affordable housing. Mid-Cambridge
is the most dense neighborhood but Mr. Barrett is talking about West
Cambridge. This is encouraging infill with some of these properties. She
stated that parking, entries to the unit, windows and window wells, density,
noise and regulations and utilities are concerns. She spoke about the
requirement of the Historical Commission regarding foundations. She did not
want the historical character of the neighborhood lost. This petition benefits
the petitioner.

Doug Brown, 35 Standish Street, signed the petition and it is a valid way to
get more housing. He agreed with the amendments proposed and limits unintended
consequences. He stated people live in sub-standard spaces, have to follow the
expensive variances or do the changes illegally. He stated that not every
accessory unit will benefit or vice versa some additional living space may be
sought and may be in a basement or attic. Regarding the historical
significance these requirements and rules still apply; approval from
Historical Commission is still required. He stated most houses are already
over on the FAR and when all the requirements are added in not much is left.
He supports this proposal and urged the City Council to pass it.

Carol O'Hare, 172 Magazine Street, stated that a major amendment has been
proposed and reached the City Council last night and did not get circulated
ahead of time. She stated that owner occupied amendment was amended from the
original petition would be dropped. She objected to the initial owner occupied
accessory apartment because there was no mechanism to ensure owner occupancy
would continue if the house was sold. This should continue longer than the
original owner occupancy provision. This amendment was not filed and due to
this amendment being major this process needs to start over again. She
submitted her comments (ATTACHMENT E). She spoke of the exclusion of the
living space from the FAR for residential units that are not accessory units
would apply to new and existing construction. The special permit process is
not the place to rezone basement space throughout the city. There should be a
uniform way to decide this in zoning. This amendment is right for the Master
Planning process or the amendment should begin the process again.

Pebble Gifford 15 Hilliard Street, stated that she has an accessory apartment
that was grandfathered. She stated that there are problems with this petition.
She suggested that each zoning district should be reviewed as to how this
would work. She stated that it is ill advised to rezone the entire City with a
broad brush as this proposal does. She was involved in drafting the original
accessory apartment ordinance in 1970. No changes could be made to the
envelope of the building. Parking was a requirement and had to be owner
occupied house and provide some income to fix the house. This has worked in a
limited way. She stated that you need a separate means of egress which is
expensive. She suggested looking at this in a district by district way and not
city-wide. Low income housing should be addressed in the Master Plan. She
stated that groups cannot be discriminated against such as a group of students
living in these units.

Amy Munsat, 71 Standish Street, stated that she is an architectural designer.
She stated that for over 25 years she has seen situations where people are
struggling to stay in their homes. There is an existing housing stock and this
is a way to allow flexibility to redesign their spaces that fits them at where
they are in their lives. This addresses numerous issues including aging in
place, addresses sustainability and livable space and adds income to families.
She stated that so many people could take advantage of this.

Jan Devereux, 255 Lakeview Avenue, signed the petition last summer and agreed
with the flexibility intent to owners to the existing housing stock. She
stated that some of the amendments are acceptable. She stated that the
additional 623 units is a limited impact because of the burden to create the
separate egress and having the capital to do this. Only half of this number
may actually benefit which is a small number of units. She added that the
current accessory housing ordinance does not require that it be owner
occupied.

James Williamson 1000 Jackson Place, spoke about flooding which is a
significant issue. He suggested taking a look at where flooding would be a
problem. Height may be an issue, unit size, livability and minimum square
footage. He likes the theory of low and moderate income people being able to
do something to remain in their homes. Protecting the affordability of the
units is a conundrum. Neighborhood density and parking are issues. He stated
that there are complexities with this. He agreed with the Planning Board on
this.

At this time Councillor Carlone assumed the chair.

Stephen Kaiser, 191 Hamilton, a homeowner of a three decker since 1972. The
discussion is for one or two family houses. He stated that if he paints his
house he can have low rents. His primary concerns are flooding and basements.
He stated that no study has been done by the proponent about the flood levels
and storms. He agreed with the Planning Board recommendation. He stated that
in July 2010 there was 4 inches of rain in 70 minutes. As a result the Public
Works building and the Somerville Fire station were flooded. This is a
practical concern and it is not addressed in the petition. He is more in
opposition. He spoke about destabilization of neighborhoods. If this were
passed it would result in high cost renovations and it would lead to high
rents and Cambridge cannot lose low and moderate income housing. He stated
that the proposal needs further study. He urged the City Council not to pass
the proposal. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT F).

Wayne Bingham, Cedar Street, stated that there is construction on each side of
his house and the children are being woken up at 7 AM. He asked why there must
be development taking place on every square inch of land in Cambridge. He
asked is the City pro-developer or pro-neighborhood. He stated that the
neighborhoods are gone.

Tony Madan stated that this is a way to get affordable housing. He spoke about
the rents charged for a basement apartment compared to a sunny upper floor
apartment. This will be an incentive for landlords being property up to code.

Public comment closed at 3:27 PM on motion of Councillor Carlone.

Vice Mayor Benzan assumed the Chair and asked the pleasure of the City
Council.

Councillor McGovern spoke about historical concerns and flooding issues will
there be a process to approve what gets built. Mr. Barrett stated that this is
to align the Building, Sanitary and Municipal Codes. All approvals will be
needed in order to build. He stated single and two family houses can be
renovated at 6'11"" without a special permit. He stated that you want ISD
inspectors to look at these units. He stated that some properties are not
allowed to do this. He stated that basements could be renovated but not be
accessory space. Councillor McGovern stated that height and density are
issues. This is a way to create affordable units and a way to let family
members, seniors and students stay in their homes. People who want to live
close to their work want to live in the City. He wanted assurance that these
units would be low income units. Mr. Barrett states that there is no owner
occupied required in the accessory apartment. He stated that if you want to
create accessory units for low income residents you can, but it is not his
intention. He wants to create flexibility and more housing for everyone, not
just affordable housing.

Councillor Carlone stated that the thrust of proposal makes sense. He
suggested above garages as added living space. Scandinavian countries build in
the attic and add elevators especially for the elderly. He stated that this
would make sense in some instances and not in others. He spoke about using a
French drain for moisture in basements. He stated that renovations needed
could be expensive and this is where the rents may be effected. The premise
makes sense. The Planning Board recommendation that this be part of the Master
Plan makes sense and getting it right makes sense.

Mayor Maher stated the petition shows the creativity for housing and access to
housing. He stated that basement overlay district was done last term along
Mass. Avenue from the Cambridge Common to Porter Square. We are seeing what
can be done in these apartments. Mr. Roberts outlined the projects that are
ongoing. Mayor Maher stated that there is a provision about the flood zone
that the Public Works Commissioner has to sign off if the units are in a flood
zone. This has merit and he is grateful that this was brought forward. There
is an opportunity to continue to look at this and have adapted the
recommendation. Mr. Barrett stated that PART A and B are different. The
accessory apartment part could be brought into the Master Plan process but the
Part B does not need study by the Master Plan. He is talking about freedom and
flexibility to use space in a safe, legal way.

Vice Mayor Benzan commended Mr. Barrett. How do we prevent a sell-off of
single and two family homes? Mr. Barrett stated that the inclusion of two
family structures complicates this proposal and he included two family units
to create units. Mr. Barrett stated that in his original proposal he included
ownership affidavit. The current ordinance does not require any chain of
ownership.

Councillor Toomey moved that the matter be referred to the full City Council
without recommendation. The motion carried on a voice vote of five members.

The following e-mail was received and made part of the report:

Communication from Carole Perrault stated that the petition is not ready for
prime time and its impact on historical and architectural character of
neighborhoods needs to be thoroughly understood (ATTACHMENT G).

Vice Mayor Benzan thanked all those present for their attendance.

The hearing adjourned at 3:52 PM.

closely with representatives from the Greater Boston Labor Council and
Community Labor United to develop an approach to preventing wage theft in the
City. I am pleased to advise you that the product of those conversations is
the attached Executive Order, which I have issued today. This Executive Order
requires that a vendor cannot be awarded a contract that is bid by the City
unless the vendor submits and complies with the attached Wage Theft Prevention
Certification. This certification imposes additional reporting and compliance
requirements and in some cases the requirement of a wage bond to ensure
protections against wage theft by vendors that are awarded City contracts that
are put out to bid. Vendors will make this certification on behalf of
themselves and any subcontractors they plan to use in performance of their
contract with the City.  
  
This Executive Order furthers the City’s ongoing commitment to wage justice,

of Cambridge has retained its noteworthy distinction of being one of
approximately 36 municipalities in the United States with AAA ratings from
each of the nation’s three major credit rating agencies. Each year since 1999,
the City has received these ratings from Moody’s Investors Service, Standard
&amp; Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. This achievement allows the City to invest
more money into important projects throughout Cambridge with a favorable
interest rate. The agencies highlighted the City’s conservative budgeting
practices and prudent use of reserves to help keep tax levy increases at a
moderate level to cover operating expenditures.  
  
These ratings are in conjunction with the City’s sale of $35 million in
General Obligation bonds, which took place on March 1, 2016. This sale will
finance capital projects such as the King Open/Cambridge Street Upper School
and Community Complex, sewer reconstruction, street and sidewalk
reconstruction, and other municipal and school building renovations.  
  
All three agencies have given the City a positive outlook. However, in
reviewing Moody’s criteria, it is important that we continue to pay attention
to the factors listed below to ensure our AAA rating in the future.  

· Material growth in the debt burden

· Deterioration of the tax base or weakening of the local economy

· Trend of operating deficits that lead to a significant reduction in reserve
levels

· Significant increases in pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB)
liabilities

  
Based on this ongoing recognition from the rating agencies, the City Council
can be justly proud of its sound fiscal policies. Additionally, I would like
to thank the City’s Department Heads and staff for their commitment to
prudently managing their budgets and programs. The City is fortunate to have
such a strong and dedicated team.

  
Attached are the rating opinions of Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service,
and Standard &amp; Poor’s Corporation.

Public Investment Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditure account in order
to implement the first phase of a citywide building security enhancement
project which includes the hiring of a technical position.

The City’s security system was discussed at the Capital Committee meetings
during the budget process. It was determined at that time, more time was
needed to put a citywide plan together. In recent months, a working group of
staff from the City, School Department, and Public Safety have collaborated on
a plan to consolidate all public buildings onto a single security platform.
This working group has established the following goals:  

· Ability to quickly and remotely secure all perimeter doors at municipal
facilities (City and School) during emergency situations, while allowing
public safety personnel necessary access.

· Capacity to provide cross-system access - particularly for public safety
personnel- so that employees can use a common device at any building where
they have permission to enter.

· Optimized efficiency through shared software, personnel and equipment across
departments wherever possible.

· Scalability in order to be able to add new facilities over time.

This appropriation includes upgrades to security systems or to install new
security systems on 19 City buildings, network improvements necessary to
support the expansion of the security system, and a full-time position to
manage the system.

It is anticipated that future budget requests will be made to support security
systems to an additional 13 City buildings as well as additional improvements
to the School Department security systems.

the Public Investment Fund Community Development Extraordinary Expenditure
account to complete the purchase of two parcels from the B&amp;M Corporation
for the purpose of creating a future multi-use path and greenway.

On June 20, 2016, City Council approved the transfer of $860,000 for this
acquisition. At the time of the appropriation, an estimate was used. In order
to complete the purchase, an additional $42,655 is required.

BACKGROUND: The 2005 Concord-Alewife Plan identified the acquisition of the
remaining Watertown Branch parcels and creation of a path as a priority for
the area in order to create additional off-road connections to Danehy Park,
Fresh Pond Mall and to create the possible future connection to a multiuse
path along the Fitchburg Line to Porter Square. At that time a zoning overlay
district was created to encourage the preservation of the rail line as open
space and conversion to a greenway and multi-use path.

FUTURE PLAN: This path will be an extension of the existing path along Fresh
Pond Parkway that is also currently being extended into Watertown through a
partnership between the City of Cambridge and the state Department of
Conservation and Recreation (DCR) known as the Watertown Cambridge Greenway.
Funds would also be used to complete a conceptual design needed to identify
opportunities, constraints and an approximate cost to construct the path in
the future.

Alewife is a busy area with many transportation needs and opportunities. A
robust and expanding off-road, multi-use path network is part of those
facilities, and is needed to encourage sustainable trips in the Alewife area
to reduce existing congestion. Paths through the area make many regional
connections into Arlington (Minuteman Bikeway), Belmont (Alewife Greenway
Extension), and Somerville (Alewife Greenway). The extended Watertown-
Cambridge Greenway will complete the connection between Cambridge and
Watertown as well as the regional link between the Minuteman Bikeway and the
Charlies River path system.

bond issue(s). The purpose is to refinance existing General Obligation Bonds
to acquire lower interest rates than those currently being paid.

Summary:

The City, in conjunction with its Financial Advisor and Bond Counsel, closely
monitors the market for favorable conditions which would potentially allow for
the City to reduce its debt service costs. The last time that the City was
able to take advantage of market conditions was in 2015, when the City
refinanced certain eligible bonds allowing it to realize savings of just over
$2 million in debt service costs. This process of recalling bonds and
reissuing them to achieve a lower interest rate is common practice. The
ability to take advantage of lower interest costs, if market conditions
permit, is received favorably by the rating agencies and demonstrates prudent
debt management practices and is included in our debt policy, which is
projected to result in a savings just under $2 million.

Timing:

The Refunding is to occur in late May or early June. If, between now and June,
market conditions should deteriorate such that it no longer meets the required
thresholds, the loan order allows for the City to take no further action, and
not proceed with the sale.

Call to Order

The City Council held a public hearing on Wednesday, February 24, 2016
beginning at 5:30 P.M. in the Sullivan Chamber.

The purpose of the hearing was to conduct a public hearing to discuss a zoning
petition filed by Peter L. Cohen, et al to amend the Zoning Ordinance to
restrict garage development in dimensionally non-conforming lots.

Present at the hearing were Mayor Simmons, Councillor Devereux, Vice Mayor
McGovern, Councillor Mazen, Councillor Cheung Councillor Kelley, Councillor
Maher, Councillor

Toomey, Jeff Roberts, Zoning and Land Use Planner, Community Development
Department (CDD) and City Clerk Donna P. Lopez.

Also present were Peter Cohen, 11 Donnell Street, Charlie Teague, 23 Edmonds
Street,

Mayor Simmons presided at the hearing due to Council Committees not being
approved. She convened the hearing and explained the purpose. She outlined the
format of the hearing. She noted that if comments were submitted by e-mail
that they would be made part of the record. She then invited the petitioner to
come forward.

Petition

The City Council heard from the petitioner, Mr. Peter L. Cohen, 11 Donnell
Street. He stated that he wanted to amend the zoning ordinance in a very
modest way that is important to him and his family. He spoke about his
neighborhood. The neighborhood contains modest two family houses, a few single
family houses and a few triple deckers. His neighbors are friendly, but not
intrusive. There is a sense of neighborhood. There are young families with
children in the neighborhood. He noted that the scale and architecture of the
homes in the neighborhood are located close to and face the street. Most homes
have off street parking and there are a few garages which are separate
structures tucked behind the homes. He stated that the exceptions are 10 and
12 Donnell Street have garages that were built into the main structure facing
the street in a townhouse style. He further stated that 7B and 7C Donnell
Street have a garage facing the street as part of the condominium structure
but is located down a driveway and 50 feet from the street. He explained that
in his residential neighborhood there are no residential units, old or new,
with a garage facing the street. He did not want the urban landscape to change
except when there is a compelling reason. He explained why this is an issue to
build a structure where the main feature facing the street is a garage.
Economic pressures could dictate an outcome that may alienate the
neighborhood. He stated that he lives next to property that is the subject of
redevelopment. He added that there are other non-conforming lots that can be
rezoned and will over time will be subject to the same redevelopment pressures
and bad outcome. The amendment that he drafted applies to other properties and
commented about unintended consequences. He spoke about the 9 Donnell Street
which is the subject of the amendment which is a two family worker's cottage
built in the l850's. Mr. Cohen proceeded with his presentation

He stated that the house at 9 Donnell Street is relatively small with a two
car garage on a lot that is 6,000 square feet. This property was owned for
sixty years by one owner but recently is in the hands of a developer. Because
of the narrowness of the lot there is a push to remove the existing house. The
current owner has brought the proposal to the Planning Board which has
approved the proposal in principal which would have two different structures
in the style of a townhouse, with a courtyard in the middle with underground
parking underneath. The neighbors were told by the property owners that there
is an alternative and they can build by right one long structure with a garage
structure in front, view I is what the structure would look like from the
street. It is his understanding that this is what the developer wants to build
on the site with Planning Board approval. During the Planning Board hearing
the Planning Board members questioned whether the development was economically
viable. He stated that the zoning could be amended to prohibit this or the
Planning Board could grant a special permit. He wanted to get ahead of this
situation before the structure is built. He depicted a reasonable development
that has a garage. He spoke about the technical and spiritual aspects of this
proposal. He stated that 101 Orchard Street depicts frontage of a house and a
garage. This amendment would only effect a narrow group of properties that are
dimensional non-conforming lots where there is a garage. He spoke of the law
of unintended consequences. He commented that developers are looking at lots
as an economic proposition. He wanted development done in a tasteful way that
does not upset neighborhood values. He stated that within the first 50 feet of
land a garage should not be built, but could apply to the Planning Board for a
special permit. He explained the structure of his petition. He stated that
Section B (2) of his petition deals with demolition during the pendency period
of the special permit application and covers historical signification
properties that are being torn down. This will codify the current practice.
Mr. Cohen stated that Section C deals with if the petition is challenged by
developers and struck down this would just prohibit garages in the front 50
feet. He spoke about the memo written by Community Development start. He
stated that language in his petition needs to be clarified. It is not the
intention to prohibit parking rather where parking is put. He wanted to find a
balance for the neighborhood and developer with neighborhood values being
primary. He noted that the language in his petition needs refinement.

Mayor Simmons requested Mr. Roberts to explain the memo from CDD.

Mr. Roberts spoke that the memo prepared for the review of the planning
issues. He stated that the Planning Board will hear the petition on March 8.
The memo contains an overview of the petition. The full impact of the petition
have not been fully studied and Residence B is a common zoning district which
contains about 4,000 lots and have not studied how many of these lots are non-
conforming. It is not typical for lots to be narrower than the 50 foot lot
width. In the current zoning ordinance between Articles Five and Six there are
a set of different requirements pertaining to parking facilities, both in
structured parking facilities such as garages as well as surface parking.
There are restrictions currently in place for smaller lots and there is more
flexibility. The issue raised with this proposal is the balance between the
requirement that housing when created has to provide parking at one space per
unit and must meet the dimensional requirement in the zoning verses having
additional restrictions that would limit where the parking is allowed to go
and be designed on the lot. Relief is sought by a special permit from the
Planning Board or variance from the Board of Zoning Appeal. Mr. Roberts added
that the petitioner did not some of the technical points made. One is that the
proposed provision is cited in Article Ten, the procedures section, of the
zoning. What is being proposed is more of a development control and belongs in
Article 5 of the zoning. He commented on the terminology of multi-family which
is standard term in zoning and building codes that refers to three units or
more. Sections B and C in the petition that discusses procedures for special
permit relief provisions are unusual compared to the way that special permits
are typically provided for in the zoning. When there is a special permit
provision there is criteria cited and if the Planning Board or BZA finds that
the project meets the zoning requirements and the criteria outlined in the
zoning then the special permit will be granted; variances require proving
hardship to have the zoning requirement relieved. These provisions if passed
needs to be reviewed to determine the legal appropriateness of the language.

Public Comment

At this time Mayor Simmons opened the hearing to public comment.

Charles Teague, 23 Edmonds Street, stated that he is the project manager for
the lot that is the target of this petition. He noted that this project is
targeted because it is next door to Attorney Cohen. He stated that this
petition is illegal. He noted that for Part A there is a letter from the
trustee of 9 Donnell Street, Mr. Robert McHale has been sent to the City
Council and is written protest to the petition ([COMMUNICATION
#3](http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&MeetingID=1553&MediaPosition=&ID=2056&CssClass=)).
The memo points that Part A is illegal in Massachusetts and alleged that this
is reverse spot zoning. This petition singles out one or more parcels and is
more restrictive than other lots in the same area. He noted that the memo from
Mr. McHale points out that it is unclear why the proposed requirements will
only apply to such non-conforming lots and not to other lots in the same
district. He stated that the quantity and characteristics of the parcels that
will be affected by the Cohen petition must be known and that the petitioner
did not do this research. He stated that he has had previous petitions that
have been enacted by the City Council. He spoke of a previous petition
submitted that failed to pass that contained language that a special permit
may normally be granted to be in compliance with state law that a special
permit may be granted. The public was questioning why special permits were
always approved. He noted that it was disappointing that the City Council did
not seek a legal opinion on this that was offered by the City Solicitor. He
announced that the approval process is set by state case law. He noted that
Part B of the petition tries to change the approval process and override state
law. He concluded that this petition is a waste of time because it is illegal.

John Tittmann, 29 Kelley Street, spoke about the livability of the streets in
Cambridge. This petition addresses an important issues. Street need to be
built and a zoning process created that insures that streets are for people to
walk on; not designed to make it more comfortable for cars. Convenient streets
created for automobiles make it dangerous for walking. He stated that putting
garage doors against street sidewalks is not good for urbanism.

Bill Wendel, 97A Garden Street, stated that garages will fade in importance in
our lifetime. He stated that the question needs to be asked is what the future
of garages is. Garages are being turned into livable space.

On a motion of Councillor Devereux public comment closed at 6:10 PM on a voice
vote of six members.

City Council Discussion

Councillor Mazen agreed with the petitioners that cars are a dying breed and
garages need to comport with certain ascetic qualities. He expressed his
frustration with the neighbor/developer conflicts and that there is immense
room for a win-win situation in this matter and that filing a zoning petition
is a last resort. There is little attempt to make the developer happy because
in this case the developer is someone in the neighborhood who owns property
and wants to make money from the property. He stated properties should not be
allowed to make money; it should be used for housing. In this situation the
designs are not unseemly; the neighborhood could have helped with the designs.
He noted that the antagonism is such that it would be difficult to arrive at a
win-win situation. He felt that the reverse spot zoning character of this
petition is illegal. He wants to say yes and this petition is not working in
this vein. He expressed his frustration with this situation and wished
neighborhoods could solve these problems substantively.

Councillor Devereux questioned Mr. Roberts if there is problem with garages in
Res. B would CDD have been thinking about this otherwise. Mr. Roberts
responded that this is not an issue that has been brought to his intention. He
stated that he was not aware of garages being put into the front of small
residential lots. The project cited by the petitioner is a case before the
Planning Board and the deals with two separate structures on a lot. He stated
that the provision of the zoning causes the developers to put forth a single
structure design that is deliberately unattractive because the provisions of
the zoning stated that the Planning Board has to make a determination that the
development of two structures is superior to a single structure. Councillor
Devereux noted that as long as this petition is active the developer is
blocked from doing anything. She questioned if the special permit is granted
does this petition stop the demolition and the development is less
economically viable the longer there is delay. Mr. Roberts responded that the
special permit was decided but the decision has not filed. He further stated
that because the decision was not filed before the petition was advertised and
if the zoning were adopted it would be effective retroactively to the date
when it was first advertised. If the City Council choses to adopt the petition
the Donnell Street project would be subject to petition because the special
permit has not been filed before the first advertisement date. The current
status of the Special Permit depends on what the City Council decides to do.
The Inspectional Services Department will not issue a building permit if the
project is in this uncertain stage of not knowing if the project conforms to
the zoning. Before a building permit is issued this petition must be resolved.

Councillor Maher added that the work done would be done at jeopardy due to the
petition. Mr. Roberts agreed that if a building permit were issued the
developer would be building at risk and if the City Council adopted the
petition the developer would have to alter the project or seek additional
relief. Councillor Maher commented that there is more going on than what is
happening at Donnell Street. This is an extremely tight street and
neighborhood and people are frustrated. He understands the frustration when
people want to change the neighborhood. He is eager to hear what the Planning
Board will say about this petition and how many properties this does effects.
He added that this neighborhood has been underseiged and the City Council has
a responsibility to act on the changes to this neighborhood. He stated that
changes will be coming to Concord Avenue.

Vice Mayor McGovern stated that he hoped that issues are resolved in a
collaborative way. He stated that there is an issue on Kinnaird Street where a
second dwelling was built with a garage in front that has caused concern for
the neighbors. He wanted a legal opinion and what the PB has to say. He wanted
to hear the risk that the City is taking on this matter. He stated that there
is creditability on this. He wanted a legal opinion.

Mayor Simmons stated that this petition could be referred to the Ordinance
Committee.

Councillor Toomey moved to keep the matter in committee. The motion carried on
a voice vote of 6 members.

The following e-mails were received and made part of the report.

1582,3275," A communication transmitting additional information from Richard C. Rossi, City Manager, relative to a request from Port Landing Landlord, LLC (“PLL”), for an aerial license for one structural canopy to be constructed over a portion of the public sidewalk at 131 Harvard Street, which originally appeared as City Manager's Agenda #35 of August 1, 2016 .","On August 1, 2016, I submitted to the City Council a request from Port Landing
Landlord, LLC (“PLL”), for an aerial license for one structural canopy to be
constructed over a portion of the public sidewalk. After discussion by the
Council at the August 1, 2016 meeting, PLL’s request was referred back to me
with a request to provide the Council further information regarding the
request. In response to the Council’s request for additional information,
please find the following supplemental information.

  
PLL has provided the attached (2) color renderings as well as an architectural
elevation drawing which show the placement and signage for the proposed canopy
as well as the street scape. PLL states that two (2) new trees are being
planted on Harvard Street along the property’s frontage. In response to the
Council’s inquiry regarding how this canopy fits into the neighborhood, PLL
states that the name of the building, “Port Landing” was chosen to reflect its
connection to community following the Council’s renaming Area 4 to the “Port.”
PLL states that this is the only 100% affordable housing development being
constructed in the City this year.

As further background, PLL states that the sign that is proposed for the
canopy was reviewed by the City’s Community Development Department (“CDD”)
pursuant to Article 7.000 of Cambridge Zoning Ordinance governing “Signs and
Illumination.” In addition, PLL represents that this project has been the
subject of four (4) neighborhood meetings over the course of four (4) years.
PLL also states that it sought and obtained a variance from the Cambridge
Board of Zoning Appeal for setback and FAR relief for this development.

As was set forth in the applicant’s August 1, 2016 application, the structural
canopy will overhang a portion of the City-owned sidewalk along Harvard Street
located along PLL’s property located at 131 Harvard Street (the “Property”).
PLL has agreed that there will be no illuminated signs installed on the canopy
structure.

The dimensions of the canopy structure in front of the Property on Harvard
Street will be approximately 41’ feet wide by 2.5’ feet deep. The top of the
canopy structure will be approximately 14.5’ feet above the sidewalk. The
total weight of the canopy structure is estimated at 1,800 pounds and is part
of the second floor structural wood frame that spans the width of the
building. I have attached a plan and renderings of the proposed canopy
structure.

The total requested license area is one thousand four hundred and eighty five
cubic feet (1,485 cu. ft.). The requested license area is depicted in the
“License Plan of Land” attached hereto. The Director of Assessing has
determined the annual fee for Fiscal Year 2017 shall be $1,039.00 which shall
be subject to annual increases.

In accordance with the Cambridge Municipal Code, the plans and renderings have
been reviewed by various City departments (Police, Fire, Water, CDD, Public
Works (including the City Engineer), Electrical, and Traffic, Parking and
Transportation). I deemed it appropriate to transmit this license request to
the City Council for its consideration pursuant to Section 12.12.200. Section
12.12.200 allows for the maintenance over the public way of a structural
canopy when a permit therefor has been authorized by the City Council. I
believe that the information furnished in this letter is sufficient to enable
the City Council to make a determination on this matter.

I recommend that the City Council vote to authorize me to grant a license, in
such form and substance as I deem appropriate, for the installation of a
structural canopy at this location.

The Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS) has awarded the
Police Department a Year Two grant to continue to fund the Focused Deterrence
project for a second year. The Focused Deterrence program consists of social
service providers, community leaders, and law enforcement agencies working
together to prevent serious and chronic offenders from engaging in criminal
behavior. At the core of the program is a shared philosophy that offenders can
be reformed with the proper support, services, and community engagement.

Year Two grant funding will allow for valuable personnel services to continue
and expand without disruption. A key component to the success of the program
is funding for our critical Social Work Case Manager position, who is a
Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW). This position has been essential to
the success of the Focused Deterrence Program and has, among other things,
worked with individuals to develop a personalized plan to address issues that
are a barrier to becoming positive members of the community and living a
healthy, successful crime-free life.

The Department’s efforts to combat criminalization and recidivism as part of
the Focused Deterrence Program include addressing substance abuse in the
community. In collaboration with community partners, the Department aims to
build on the success of the Focused Deterrence Program and utilize Other
Ordinary Maintenance funds to focus on substance abuse prevention and
training, with the ultimate public safety goal of saving lives and deterring
future criminal behavior.

1618,3632, The City Manager confer with the City Solicitor on the possibility of allowing non-citizen Cambridge residents to vote in municipal elections without a home-rule petition.,"WHEREAS:

|

Cambridge is a City that respects, values, and wishes to nurture the diversity
among its residents, and has been progressive in the past by passing
legislation meant to improve the lives of the residents it serves; and  
  
---|---  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

Non-citizen residents in Cambridge are fellow taxpayers concerned with issues
of local governance and representation, but are presently barred from formally
voicing their opinions as a constituency since the right to vote locally is
not instituted and requires a Home Rule petition; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

In 2005, the Cambridge City Council sent a home rule petition to enable non-
citizen voting rights in our city elections: the petition failed to pass in
the State House then, and since the proportion of foreign-born residents in
Cambridge has increased; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

According to the 2014 American Communities Survey conducted by the US Census,
Cambridge has over 30,000 foreign-born residents, with more than half being
non-citizens;  given the bureaucratic nature of the naturalization process, it
can take well over a decade to fully enfranchise immigrants who have taken the
necessary steps to apply for full citizenship, thus it often takes a decade or
more to gain a stake in the decisions of their chosen local government; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

Important debates and discussions in the city affect citizen residents just as
they affect non-citizen residents who enroll their children in Cambridge
public schools, pay local, state, and federal taxes, and contribute to our
communities on a daily basis; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

Parents’ involvement in the education of their children is proven to be
pivotal to student academic achievement; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

There are some municipalities in the country that have passed immigrant voting
rights locally, and in Massachusetts alone, Brookline, Amherst, Newton, and
Cambridge have submitted home rule petitions to the State Legislature seeking
non-citizen voting rights for foreign-born residents; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

Cambridge residents, regardless of citizenship, complete the annual City
Census, which the city uses as the basis for creating the voter list, meaning
that if non-citizen voting were instituted in our City, there could be less
burden to our existing framework for municipal voting; and  
  
|  
  
WHEREAS:

|

This policy seeks to enfranchise residents presently barred from voting due to
their citizenship status, excluding non-immigrant visa holders, so that they
may participate equally with their fellow community members in City Council
and School Committee elections; and now therefore be it  
  
|  
  
ORDERED:

|

That the City Council go on record petitioning the Massachusetts General Court
to enact the attached Home Rule Petition entitled “AN ACT TO EMPOWER NON-
CITIZEN RESIDENTS OF CAMBRIDGE TO VOTE IN CITY COUNCIL AND SCHOOL COMMITTEE
ELECTIONS” and further order that the City Manager’s office work to confer
with the City Solicitor on the possibility of enacting this ordinance without
need for a Home Rule petition.

1873,5131," A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to an amendment to the City’s previous submission of a Home Rule Petition to the Legislature whereby I requested authorization to include in the planned reconstruction (the “Project”) of the King Open / Cambridge Street Upper School and Community Complex (“KOCSUS”) the area that is presently occupied by the public swimming pool known as the Gold Star Pool (the “Pool Site”) and to construct subsurface geothermal wells in a portion of Donnelly Field that lies directly along and adjacent to the current southerly boundary of the KOCSUS site.","I am writing with regard to the City’s previous submission of a Home Rule
Petition to the Legislature whereby I requested authorization to include in
the planned reconstruction (the “Project”) of the King Open / Cambridge Street
Upper School and Community Complex (“KOCSUS”) the area that is presently
occupied by the public swimming pool known as the Gold Star Pool (the “Pool
Site”) and to construct subsurface geothermal wells in a portion of Donnelly
Field that lies directly along and adjacent to the current southerly boundary
of the KOCSUS site. Both the area proposed for the construction of the
subsurface geothermal wells and the Gold Star Pool are presently owned and
held by the City for “public park and park” purposes and therefore are
protected under Article 97 from any change in use absent legislation
authorizing such a change in use.  
  
In order to proceed with the design of the Project as planned, to construct
the subsurface geothermal wells within a portion of Donnelly Field and to
relocate the Gold Star Pool Site as part of the overall Project, I previously
requested that the City Council vote in favor of filing a Home Rule Petition.
As I previously informed you in my original submission to the Council with
regard to the proposed home rule petition, the new location of the Gold Star
Pool, which will be adjacent to Berkshire Street and Donnelly Field, will be
beneficial to the City and the community because it allows for a larger pool
and deck space, a new wading pool, and it faces south with a direct connection
to Donnelly Field. The new location allows better visibility from Berkshire
Street and Donnelly Field. The new pool house and changing rooms will be
located on the first level of the three story building, and the school
administrative offices will be located above the pool house and changing
rooms.  
  
On August 1, 2016, the City Council voted in favor of filing the proposed Home
Rule Petition and the Home Rule Petition was duly filed. The Petition went
through both the House and the Senate. However, the City was recently informed
by a representative of the state’s Executive Office of Environmental Affairs
(“EOEA”) that the City’s project description and plans, which appeared to
reduce the amount of existing open space to a smaller amount of open space,
were disfavored by the Legislature. EOEA also pointed out that the square
footage of open space that the City referenced in its proposed legislation
(11,733 sf) included only the relocated swimming pool, and that the relocated
pool house structure, that will have two additional levels of school
administration offices above it, is not included in the area to be protected
as open space. We were informed that EOEA believes that the proposed Home Rule
Petition would be more likely looked upon favorably by the Legislature if it
were to include all of the relocated pool area as part of the open space area,
including the pool house structure, even though the relocated pool house
structure would be located at the ground level of a structure that would have
two additional floors of school administration office space above it. By
including all of the relocated pool area and pool house structure as part of
the open space area, the new open space area including the pool house
structure will be larger than the Pool Area at its existing location, and the
overall open space area will be increased from the existing 17,892 square feet
to the new 18,459 square feet.  
  
Relief is also required from the Legislature to construct subsurface
geothermal wells within a portion of Donnelly Field that lies directly along
and adjacent to the southern edge of the School Site. All existing “public
park and park” uses that are conducted in that part of Donnelly Field will
continue to be conducted after the installation of the subsurface geothermal
wells and reconstruction of the existing recreational facilities at that part
of the site. This part of the original Home Rule Petition remains unchanged.  
  
I am therefore requesting that you approve the submission of the attached
amended Home Rule Petition to the Legislature. I have also attached for your
information a plot plan showing (a) the existing swimming pool area, (b) the
proposed swimming pool area, and (c) the proposed geothermal pool area, and
site renderings showing the existing and proposed site conditions and
calculations relating to the existing and proposed pool locations at the
proposed Project Site.

Public Investment Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures account for the
purchase of green landscaping equipment for various City departments to begin
using this fall.

DPW will purchase a full set of battery powered leaf blowers for use by all
City departments. This equipment costs approximately $25,000 and includes 21
Battery operated blowers, 21 chargers, and 42 batteries to ensure we have 2
batteries for every blower. This equipment will be used by City staff and its
performance will be gauged in comparison with gas powered equipment. This
equipment has noise levels at or below 60 decibels to comply with the City’s
leaf blower ordinance. Equipment will be used by the Water Department, Human
Services Department, Traffic Department and Department of Public Works.

Additionally, the Department of Public Works will seek to use green (battery
and electric powered equipment) in two parks as part of a spring of 2017
pilot. The two parks have yet to be definitively identified but we expect them
to be representative parks in terms of equipment needs. The City will measure
the effectiveness of such equipment through the spring of 2017. This equipment
will be operated by DPW crews. The cost of this equipment will be
approximately $100,000 and will include, string trimmers, and both walk behind
and ride-on mowers. The purchase will also include a charging trailer along
with additional batteries.
