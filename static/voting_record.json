   "item_body": "I request that the City Council vote to designate the contracted part-time\nposition of property appraiser as a special municipal employee for purposes of\nthe state Conflict of Interest Law, G.L.c.268A, by adopting the attached\nOrder.\n\nThe City occasionally contracts with third-party property appraisers to\nperform appraisals for the City. For purposes of the Massachusetts Conflict of\nInterest Law, when the City contracts with a particular appraiser, that\nappraiser is considered a regular municipal employee, subject to all the\nConflict of Interest Law\u2019s restrictions on regular municipal employees. If the\nCity Council designates this position to be that of a special municipal\nemployee, certain of the Conflict of Interest Law\u2019s restrictions would apply\nless broadly to such individuals, including G.L.c.268A, s.17 which pertains in\npart to acting as agent for third parties on matters of interest to the City,\nand G.L.c.268A, s.20 which pertains to having more than one contract with the\nsame City. Some contracted property appraisers have requested that the\nposition of contracted property appraiser be designated by the City Council as\na special municipal employee so that the Conflict of Interest Law will not\nexcessively restrict their private professional activities.\n\nPursuant to G.L.c.268A, positions, not individuals, may be designated as\nspecial municipal employees by vote of the City Council if the position is\npart-time allowing work by the individual holding the position at another job\nduring normal working hours; or the position is not paid by the city for more\nthan 800 working hours during a 365 day period. The position at issue meets\nboth of these conditions.\n\nG.L.c.268A, s.17 generally prohibits municipal employees from representing a\nprivate party before municipal boards or departments. It also prohibits\nmunicipal employees from acting as agent for a private party in connection\nwith any matter of direct and substantial interest to their city or town.\nFinally, it prohibits municipal employees from accepting pay or other\ncompensation in connection with any matter of direct and substantial interest\nto their municipality. However, a special municipal employee may: (a)\nrepresent private parties before municipal boards other than his/her own in\ncertain circumstances; (b) act as agent for private parties in connection with\na matter of interest to the City in certain circumstances; and (c) receive pay\nor other compensation in connection with matters involving the City in certain\ncircumstances.  \n  \nG.L.c.268A, s.20 generally prohibits municipal employees from having a direct\nor indirect financial interest in a contract with their city or town. However,\na special municipal employee has the following exemptions to section 20: A\nspecial municipal employee may have a financial interest in a contract with a\ndepartment which is completely independent of the one where he/she works,\nprovided that a disclosure is filed with the City Clerk. A special municipal\nemployee may have a financial interest in a contract with his/her own\ndepartment, with the appropriate disclosure and approvals. A special municipal\nemployee may also hold any number of other special municipal employee\npositions, with the appropriate disclosure and approvals.  \n  \nTherefore, for the above reasons, I request that the City Council vote to\ndesignate the position of contracted part-time property appraiser as that of a\nspecial municipal employee.\n\n",

   "item_body": "I would like to request that the City Council establish the Richard C. Rossi\nHousing Assistance Fund (the \u201cFund\u201d), and that $35,641.46 in donations\nreceived be appropriated into this Fund. The proposed Fund is attached hereto\nfor the City Council\u2019s review and approval, together with the proposed\nProcedures and Guidelines for the Fund.  \n  \nWith the retirement of City Manager Richard Rossi, the Housing Assistance Fund\nin his name was established through the Friends of Richard Rossi, and\ndonations were received for this fund during the fall of 2016.  \n  \nThe purpose of this Fund is to provide limited emergency financial assistance\nto residents experiencing difficulty remaining housed Cambridge. Pending\navailability, the Fund will be used to assist Cambridge residents primarily in\nthe following areas:\n\n\u00b7 First month\u2019s rent (and, where required, last month\u2019s) and security deposit\nfor households needing these funds in order to lease a new unit (e.g. for an\ninclusionary unit) - funds could supplement funds offered through other\nsources including the Multi-Service Center;\n\n\u00b7 Funds for families at risk of foreclosure due to mortgage and/or condo fee\narrearages - there are currently no funds available for this which can be a\nsignificant issue for lower income homeowners as fees and legal costs can\nquickly add significantly when an owner falls behind in payments.\n\n\u00b7 Credit repair - credit can be a big barrier to accessing housing, especially\nfor lower income applicants with poor credit. Access to funds to address (with\nsome limit) credit issues to repair credit could help some applicants who are\nnow denied based on credit; and\n\n\u00b7 Funds for families at risk of homelessness due to rent arrearages - funds\ncould supplement funds offered through other and/or be offered to households\nwho are not eligible for other funds.\n\nI am very pleased to be recommending the creation of this Fund and I\nrespectfully request that the City Council approve the creation of the Fund in\nthe form attached hereto. As City Manager and Deputy City Manager, Richard\nRossi was dedicated to the creation and preservation of affordable housing and\nimproving access to affordable housing in Cambridge. The Richard C. Rossi\nHousing Assistance Fund will, in Mr. Rossi\u2019s name, continue this commitment by\nhelping residents access new housing and assisting in efforts to keep\nresidents with housing risks suitably housed in Cambridge.\n\n",

Building Permits\nfor the construction of three residential dwelling units or less are exempt\nfrom the fee increase to $20.00 per thousand, as set forth in the proposed\nBuilding Permit Fee schedule.\n\nThe Building Permit Fees are set by the Municipal Code, and therefore they may\nonly be changed by a vote of the City Council.  \n  \nProposed fee increases are summarized in the attached table.\n\n",

   "item_body": "I am writing to request that you approve the submission of the attached Home\nRule Petition that would authorize the City of Cambridge to include in the\nplanned reconstruction (the \u201cProject\u201d) of the King Open / Cambridge Street\nUpper School and Community Complex (\u201cKOCSUS\u201d) the area that is presently\noccupied by the public swimming pool known as the Gold Star Pool (the \u201cGold\nStar Pool Site\u201d) and to construct subsurface geothermal wells in a portion of\nDonnelly Field that lies directly along and adjacent to the current southerly\nboundary of the KOCSUS site (the \u201cSchool Site\u201d).\n\nSpecifically, relief is required from the Legislature to construct a portion\nof the KOCSUS Project on the existing Gold Star Pool Site, which occupies a\nsmall portion of the currently existing School Site that was not included in\nChapter 49 of the Acts of 1955 (the \u201c1955 Legislation\u201d) by which a portion of\nthe original Donnelly Field site (that had comprised the entire block\nstretching easterly from Cambridge Street to Berkshire Street, south along\nBerkshire to York Street, west along York to Willow and then north along\nWillow to Cambridge Street (\u201cOriginal Donnelly Field Site\u201d)) was authorized to\nbe changed from its then \u201cpublic park and park purposes\u201d and re-used \u201cfor the\nerection of a public school building, and for other school purposes, and for\nall purposes incidental thereto\u201d. When the 1955 Legislation was passed, the\nportion of what was to become the School Site remained part of the Original\nDonnelly Field Site to continue to be used for \u201cpublic park and park\u201d purposes\nbecause it was used and occupied by the Gold Star Pool prior to 1955. It\ncontinues to be used and occupied by the Gold Star Pool today.\n\nRelief is also required from the Legislature to construct subsurface\ngeothermal wells within a portion of Donnelly Field that lies directly along\nand adjacent to the southern edge of the School Site. All existing \u201cpublic\npark and park\u201d uses that are conducted in that part of Donnelly Field will\ncontinue to be conducted after the installation of the subsurface geothermal\nwells.\n\nPursuant to Article 97 of the Articles of Amendment to the Constitution of the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts (\u201cArticle 97\u201d), land that is held and dedicated\nfor parkland uses may only be re-used for another use with the consent of two\nthirds of both houses of the Legislature.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n1. The Gold Star Pool\n\nThe City\u2019s architect has completed the Schematic Design phase for the KOCSUS\nProject. The design for the KOCSUS Project includes reconstruction of the Gold\nStar Pool and moving the pool south of the existing location. The new location\nof the Gold Star Pool, which will be adjacent to Berkshire Street and Donnelly\nField, will be beneficial to the City and the community because it allows for\na larger pool and deck space, a new wading pool, and it faces south with a\ndirect connection to Donnelly Field. The proposed new location allows better\nvisibility from Berkshire Street and Donnelly Field. The new location is\nsmaller than the existing location (11,773 sf verses 17,890 sf); however, it\nwill provide a more optimized and efficient building layout for the overall\nProject. The new pool house and changing rooms will be located on the first\nlevel of the three story building, and the school administrative offices will\nbe located above the pool house and changing rooms.\n\n2. Geothermal Wells\n\nThe KOCSUS Project is being designed as a Net Zero Emissions (\u201cNZE\u201d) project.\nThe two main systems helping to facilitate that goal are photovoltaic panels\n(\u201cPV\u201d) which produce electricity, and the subsurface geothermal wells that\nprovide tempered water for heating and cooling the building. The PVs are\nprimarily on the roof and the geothermal wells will be below grade. The\nsubsurface geothermal wells will be installed in areas that will not have any\nbuilding structures above them. The new building and site design will\nsignificantly increase the green space around the Project buildings at the\nSchool Site.\n\nThe Project design requires 190 wells. They are spaced 20\u2019 apart, and even\nwith the additional green space on the Project Site, the 190 wells cannot all\nfit within the existing School Site. The area outside of the School Site that\nis proposed for the balance of the subsurface geothermal wells is the strip of\nland along the northern edge of Donnelly Field between Willow and Berkshire\nStreets that is presently used for a seating area, basketball courts, and the\nFrisoli play area. In the final constructed condition, the subsurface\ngeothermal wells and piping will reside underground and remain unseen while\nthe disturbed surface will be restored and replaced with a new park,\nbasketball courts and seating area.\n\nHOME RULE LEGISLATION\n\nBoth the area proposed for the construction of the subsurface geothermal wells\nand the Gold Star Pool are presently located in parts of the Original Donnelly\nField Site, which is owned and held by the City for \u201cpublic park and park\u201d\npurposes and therefore is protected under Article 97 from any change in use\nabsent legislation authorizing such a change in use. In order to proceed with\nthe design of the Project as planned, to construct the subsurface geothermal\nwells within a portion of Donnelly Field and to use the Gold Star Pool Site as\npart of the overall site for the Project, I ask that the City Council vote in\nfavor of filing the attached Home Rule Petition.\n\nI have attached for your information a site plan and plan attachment sheets\ndepicting the restrictions on the existing Original Donnelly Field Site, the\ndescription of the requests and benefits of the proposed changes that are\nrequested, site renderings showing the existing and proposed site conditions,\nand calculations relating to the existing and proposed pool locations at the\nproposed Project Site.\n\n",

At that time a zoning overlay\ndistrict was created to encourage the preservation of the rail line as open\nspace and conversion to a greenway and multi-use path.\n\nFUTURE PLAN: This path will be an extension of the existing path along Fresh\nPond Parkway that is also currently being extended into Watertown through a\npartnership between the City of Cambridge and the state Department of\nConservation and Recreation (DCR) known as the Watertown Cambridge Greenway.\nFunds would also be used to complete a conceptual design needed to identify\nopportunities, constraints and an approximate cost to construct the path in\nthe future.\n\nAlewife is a busy area with many transportation needs and opportunities. A\nrobust and expanding off-road, multi-use path network is part of those\nfacilities, and is needed to encourage sustainable trips in the Alewife area\nto reduce existing congestion. Paths through the area make many regional\nconnections into Arlington (Minuteman Bikeway), Belmont (Alewife Greenway\nExtension), and Somerville (Alewife Greenway). The extended Watertown-\nCambridge Greenway will complete the connection between Cambridge and\nWatertown as well as the regional link between the Minuteman Bikeway and the\nCharlies River path system.\n\n",

   "item_id": "4974",
   "item_body": "I am requesting authorization to transfer a leasehold interest in the property\nat 1-15 Vail Court, Cambridge, also known as 139 Bishop Allen Drive, (\u201cthe\nProperty\u201d) to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust so that the Trust may\nmove forward with the redevelopment of the Property as affordable housing for\nlow- and moderate-income households. I am also requesting that the City\nCouncil appropriate $750,000 for the demolition of the two structures on the\nProperty.  \n  \nAs you know, in September 2016 the City Council approved the taking of the\nProperty by eminent domain after many years and much frustration in the\ncommunity about blighted condition of buildings there. Since that time the\nCity has taken ownership of the Property, and has secured and inspected the\ntwo structures there. A Board of Survey has determined that the buildings are\nphysically unsound and must be demolished. Building inspections have also\nshown that the buildings contain hazardous materials.  \n  \nThe City has developed a plan for abatement of hazardous materials and\ndemolition of the existing structures. Bids have been obtained for this\nproject and costs are estimated to be $750,000. I am requesting that the City\nCouncil appropriation $750,000 for this effort so that the buildings can be\ndemolished in the coming months.  \n  \nWhile planning for the demolition of the buildings, the City has also\nconsidered how best to advance the redevelopment of the property acknowledging\nthe interest in using the property for affordable housing expressed by the\nCity Council when approving the eminent domain order.  \n  \nThe City, through the City Manager\u2019s Office, held a public meeting on March\n23, 2017 to update the community on the status of the buildings, and to\nsolicit additional input on the future use of the Property. The meeting was\nattended by more than 50 residents, including abutters, other residents, as\nwell as representatives from affordable housing organizations. There was\nstrong support at the meeting for redeveloping the property as affordable\nhousing. There were also several comments from abutters advocating for the\ninclusion of green space, as well as comments that the height, size, and\nlayout of any new buildings should be appropriate for the neighborhood. Many\nmeeting attendees also expressed gratitude to the City for taking steps to\naddress conditions at the Property after many years of frustration.  \n  \nIn keeping with the high priority the City Council has placed on creating\naffordable housing and the input we heard from the community, I am\nrecommending that the City Council approve the authorization to transfer a\nleasehold interest in the property to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust\nfor the construction of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income.\nLeasing the land to the Trust for 99 years will allow for the development of\naffordable housing while allowing the City to retain ownership of the\nunderlying land.  \n  \nThe transfer of an interest in real estate to the Trust for the construction\nof low- and moderate-income housing is exempt from the provisions of the\nDisposition Ordinance, Chapter 2.110 of the Cambridge Municipal Code. Chapter\n40, \u00a715A of the General Laws governs the transfer of municipal property from\none municipal use to another. Ordinarily, General Laws Chapter 40, \u00a7 15A\nrequires a two-thirds vote for such a transfer; however, the statute provides\nthat when the transfer is for the purpose of constructing low- and moderate-\nincome housing, a simple majority vote is required.  \n  \nI believe that the Affordable Housing Trust is best suited to initiate the\nredevelopment of the Property as affordable housing in a way that balances\ncommunity housing needs with the desire for an appropriately scaled\ndevelopment and site layout. The Trust will also ensure that the City\u2019s\ninvestment in the Property is leveraged with other public and private funding\nto complete high-quality development that benefits the community.  \n  \nNext Steps  \n  \nThe City has scheduled a community meeting for June 14, 2017 to update the\ncommunity on the plan for hazardous material abatement and demolition.\nAbatement and demolition work is expected to occur in the coming months.  \n  \nCity staff will also begin work with the Trust to schedule public meetings to\nsolicit information on city-wide housing needs and identify possible\naffordable housing uses so that the best affordable housing use of the\nProperty can be determined. City staff and the Trust will also work with the\nCity Manager\u2019s office, the Community Development Department, neighbors, and\nother stakeholders, to develop guidance for the chosen developer around\nbuilding and site design, to ensure a thoughtfully designed development that\nwill benefit future residents of the housing as well as the surrounding\nneighborhood. The Trust will incorporate identified affordable housing\nobjective(s) and guidelines for site design to into a Request for\nQualifications (RFQ) to select a developer capable of carrying out the project\nas envisioned.  \n  \nTo continue progress with advancing efforts to redevelop the property, I\nrecommend the City Council appropriate of $750,000 from Free Cash to the\nPublic Investment Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures Account to\nfacilitate the abatement and demolition of the existing structures on the\nsite, and that the City Council also approve authorization to transfer the a\nleasehold interest in property to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust for\nthe construction of low- and moderate-income housing.\n\n",

The\npowerful vision for early childhood that guided the development of the report\nwas:  \n\nAll children in Cambridge receive high quality early education and care from\nbirth through third grade. As a result, all children enter school ready to\nthrive academically, socially, emotionally and continue to do so through third\ngrade and beyond.  \n\nThe report included a set of recommendations to the City to support the\ndevelopment of an early childhood system. The Task Force was made up of city\nand school department representatives, parents, health and early childhood\nexperts from community based organizations and family childcare settings. With\nsupport from national experts in the field, we reviewed the research to\nidentify best practices nationally and locally. We engaged in a needs\nassessment process, surveying local providers and doing focus groups with\nparents, principals, teachers, early childhood providers and others. What\nemerged from the research and the needs assessment confirmed the availability\nof many strong programs and services within Cambridge, but also confirmed the\nsignificant challenges families and providers face without a coherent system\nthat links families, early childhood providers, and the schools. The Task\nForce recognized that it would be a multi-year ongoing effort to build an\neffective early childhood system that would improve the outcomes for\nCambridge\u2019s children.  \n  \nThe report proposed that a critical first step in this process was to create\nan effective Birth through Third Grade governance structure tasked with\nturning the recommendations of this report into a full-fledged strategic plan\nwith measurable goals and benchmarks. The governance structure will include\nthe full range of stakeholders in the Cambridge\u2019s early education and care\ncommunity including families, early childhood providers, school and city\nofficials, higher education partners and health/mental health partners. The\ngovernance body will be charged with overseeing the development and\nimplementation of the strategic plan. Also critical to the implementation of\nthe plan is the development of agreed upon quality standards in early learning\nsettings since Cambridge\u2019s children are served in a diverse array of programs\nand settings. Family support and family engagement play a central role in the\nEarly Childhood Task Force report, and developing strategies and benchmarks in\nthose areas is also critical.  \n  \nIn November, I had indicated that I would be returning to the City Council\nwith a request for an appropriation for start-up funds to be used in this\nfiscal year to position the City to begin the implementation work in the next\nfiscal year. The funds would be used to hire the Early Childhood Director and\nthe Program Quality Specialist and to work with our consultants and key\nstakeholders to develop a significant portion of the draft strategic plan,\nwhich will include preliminary process and outcome benchmarks for governance,\nquality, access and family engagement.  \n  \nThe costs for start-up in this fiscal year are $150,000. Of that amount,\n$60,000 represents the initial salary for the two positions for the last part\nof FY16 and funding to continue the work to support the Birth to Grade 3\nalignment work with community providers. An additional $90,000 will support\nthe work with stakeholders in developing the draft strategic plan and draft\noutcomes and benchmarks, development and analysis of alternate scholarship\nsystems for supporting access within quality programs, and to explore models\nfor a quality pilot with community sites. We will also be developing more\naccurate information for the proposed budget for FY17 by the spring, but we\nanticipate that the costs will be approximately 1.3 million dollars. Those\ncosts would grow by approximately another one million dollars for year 2,\nFY18.\n\n",

Denise Simmons\n\nCouncillor Timothy Toomey\n\n|  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Public Safety Committee held a public hearing on December 14, 2015\nbeginning at 3:02 P.M. in the Sullivan Chamber.\n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to discuss the climate change vulnerability\nassessment.\n\nPresent at the hearing were Councillor Craig Kelley, Chair of the Committee,\nCouncillor Dennis J. Carlone, Councillor E. Denise Simmons, Councillor Marc\nMcGovern, Councillor Nadeem Mazen, Susanne Rasmussen, Director, Environmental\nand Transportation Planning Division of Community Development Department, Owen\nO\u2019Riordan, Public Works Commissioner, Kathy Watkins, City Engineer, Sam\nLipson, Director, Environmental Health, Public Health Department and City\nClerk  \nDonna P. Lopez.\n\nAlso present were Jan Devereux, 255 Lakeview Avenue, Megan Brooks, 103 Inman\nStreet, Ann F. Durbin, 78 Pearson Avenue, Somerville, Andrea Wilder, 12\nArlington Street and Robert Winters, 366 Broadway.\n\nCouncillor Kelley convened the hearing and explained the purpose. He submitted\nan agenda for the hearing (ATTACHMENT A). He explained the format. He would\ngive his overview, then City staff and general discussion. The Climate Change\nVulnerability Assessment Report (CCVA) is focused on sea level rise and storm\nwater surge, precipitation and temperature with three planning horizons.\nExperts talk about things using terms that regular people do not understand.\nHe stated that if the City wants the CCVA report taken seriously it needs to\nbe understandable from the public perspective. He spoke about the need for\ngraphics rather than text. He stated that this needs to be sold similar to an\ninsurance project. He asked city staff to explain the CCVA process.\n\nSusanne Rasmussen, CDD, stated that the themes were selected from\nconversations with climate change experts and scientist. Heat, sea level rise\nand storm surge were identified as threats. The findings from the climate\nchange study will be published in February. The scope of the plan is being\nfinalized. The biggest challenge is to integrate this with the city-wide plan\nwhich will cover the preparedness plan. She stated that on December 3rd the\nCity held a public meeting to discuss climate change issues and how to address\nthe threats. She stated that there is a regional collaboration about climate\nchange preparedness.\n\nCommissioner O'Riordan stated that smaller groups in the community will meet\nto have conversations about climate change, to see the impacts and to\nunderstand the concerns of various communities about climate change. He stated\nthat the City takes climate change impacts seriously over the short and long\nterm. There needs to be consensus for change.\n\nSam Lipson spoke about the health aspects in the assessment. This is meant to\ncreate a realistic view. The direct relationship increase in heat and\nmortality is impressive. What is the additional stress to a population? There\nwas a challenge in the assessment to talk about the health effect\nappropriately and there is not a lot of consensus on what is going to happen\nwith temperature increases. He stated that in the City\u2019s technical report you\nwill see more talk about disease vectors like mosquito borne illnesses, etc.\nidentified as issues to be concerned about as they relate to climate change.\nThis is meant to be look at a system risk perspective and includes the keeping\nof food, food safety and distribution problems. Systemic risks such as power\noutages will be considered. This type of information is not in the report that\nhas been released but will be in a future white paper that talks about what\nhappens under various likely scenarios.\n\nCouncillor Kelley asked how we manage the information, knowledge and events\nsuch as the public meetings to be held. How is the public informed of the\nmeetings? How do we get a representative public involved? Ms. Rasmussen noted\nthat all the public meetings are advertised and the web site will reflect all\nactivities. The smaller meetings will be arranged from direct outreach. Mr.\nO'Riordan stated that neighborhood groups, pastors, business organization will\nbe utilized with the hope that this information be transferred to other\ninterested persons. Extreme heat and flooding are primary means that climate\nchange will affect us with secondary issues such as power outages, food\nsecurity and then illnesses. The initial thoughts are for City staff to go to\norganizations in the community and ask people who are interested in this to\nparticipate with the City in this matter. It is a new area for City staff and\nthey want to be flexible in their approach. The CCVA is a stress test and as\nwe move to the preparedness plan additional stresses will be studied and put\ninto the public domain. The assessment took three years and the planning is\nprobably going to take two. The best science and engineering was used for the\nassessment and the complex modeling required special computing access which\nled to delays. He stated that meetings have been scheduled for Harvard Square\nand Mid-Cambridge neighborhood association. Ms. Rasmussen stated that all\nactivities will be posted when they are finalized. The two meetings are not\nposted now. Councillor Kelley wanted to go to the web site and map out the\nCity meetings scheduled. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that staff is being\nasked to attend association meetings and are on their agenda for 5-10 minutes.\nHe stated that Councillor Kelley's wishes will be respected to post the\nmeetings.\n\nCouncillor McGovern stated that neighborhood organizations are good places to\ngo. He stated that only the most robust neighborhood organizations represent a\ntrue segment of the neighbors. He suggested working with the school\ndepartment, perhaps through their curriculum, and to have larger meetings with\nthe community. He stated that outreach at the neighborhood organizations are\nonly a piece of the notification process. He suggested using the City Council\nto promote these meetings as well. Ms. Rasmussen stated that the City-wide\nMaster Plan outreach will be a significant way to talk to people. This will\nstart in the Alewife area. The CCVA is such a critical part of forward\nplanning.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that there are critical zones that will be impacted.\nHe suggested having meetings in these areas. He suggested using television and\ncable. He spoke of the impact of state bridges and roads blocking effective\ndrainage and making flooding worse. How has the state been involved?\nCommissioner O'Riordan it was through DOT\u2019s Central Artery study that the City\nobtained its modeling. He also stated that Department of Conservation &amp;\nResources (DCR) has looked at their bridges and dams (Craddick Dam on Mystic\nRiver and the Charles River Dam). He spoke about the importance of having\nthese systems operate correctly even for less significant storm events and the\ncritical importance of having the pumps working for major events. The City is\nlooking at regional flood prevention efforts, especially for big events, and\nMass DOT must be involved.\n\nCouncillor Carlone spoke about Route 2 development, the fact that Route 2 acts\nas a type of dam, and the option of expanding wetlands and greenspace and\nlooking at water retention. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that maps produced\nare results of rare events projected for 2070. But smaller events, 5-10 years,\nneed to be understood as well as even with non-major events, flooding can\noverwhelm the bridges and drainage systems and once on the site, water cannot\neasily be removed. He stated that the smaller events can benefit from storm\nwater management planning but that, realistically, there is not much that can\nbe done for major storm water events like a 100 year storm. In that case, our\nefforts are simply going to be inconsequential.\n\nCouncillor Simmons spoke about the importance of outreach to the community and\nits two part nature - normal, customary people and the harder to reach people.\nShe suggested looking at the neighborhood and proposing to reach 10% of the\nneighborhood and break it down to ethnicity. She wanted to see this data\nbroken down. She wanted a quantifiable way of reaching the community. She\nstated that how the outreach is done must be very creative to figure out how\nspecific populations find this issue relevant. We are being creative to reach\nout to these communities she suggested using the Church service as a method of\nnotification, to include going to services, offering meals and so forth.\n\nSam Lipson stated that the conversation is just beginning about outreach now\nthat the CCVA is done, especially how to reach people who are not usually\nreached. He stated that the Public Health Department had to get creative with\nthe types of questions asked and used focus groups to formulate the questions\nas was done with the Community Health Assessment. There are existing groups,\nsuch as Baby U, that can also add communications value. He spoke about the\nnumber of people who responded to the survey on line. Climate change\nvulnerability reflects are old concerns, not new ones. Being prepared is not\nnew. He stated that vulnerability, and preparedness, is a household by\nhousehold issue as each household has a different set of concerns. It\u2019s about\ngetting ready for a snowstorm and more. Councillor Simmons spoke about people\nparticipating to keep themselves safe. She stated that this needs to be multi-\nlingual and constant, maybe use \u201cClimate Ambassadors\u201d to provide a level of\nauthenticity. She stated that the City Council may be able to engage more\npeople to attend these meeting. She spoke about poverty and access to good\nfood. She asked if there is a correlation that poorer areas are more\nvulnerable. Mr. Lipson stated that they are starting to identify resources\ncommunities rely on for flooding and, sometimes, heat risks. Councillor\nSimmons asked if asthma was correlated to poverty. Commissioner O'Riordan\nresponded in the affirmative. Councillor Simmons noted that the City Council\ncan help provide resources in these key communities. If the eastern part of\nthe City is more vulnerability, then the community benefit mitigation funds\ncould be used in those neighborhoods. She also noted that it will be necessary\nto make repeat visits to various places at different times.\n\nCouncillor Kelley opened the hearing to public comment.\n\nMegan Brooks, 103 Inman Street, stated that she has not read any of the\nreports. The general planning should be connected to the City. She stated that\npreparing and protecting the environment is bigger than any other issue of the\nCity. She wanted preparedness put above any other thing in the City. If the\nland is overdeveloped it will be harder to prepare for these problems.\n\nAndrea Wilder, 12 Arlington Street, became aware of this 5-6 years ago when\nshe learned from the Boston Harbor Association that the height of the water\nfrom Boston Harbor would affect the Moakley Steps. She stated that Cambridge\ndoes not know what Boston will be doing. She stated that her concern is the\ntransportation for the Redline to stay dry and preventing this subway from\nbecoming a river. She stated that open spaces act like sponges by planting\ntrees. She would like green space increased with trees that provide shade. She\nspoke about building material and shingles used. She stated that CDD and\nspecial permits requirements need to be reviewed and changed to reflect the\nreality of climate change to use non-heat sink building materials and so\nforth. She spoke about changes in insurance policies that will affect homes\nand building and how buildings will have to, like the Spaulding building in\nCharlestown, compensate for climate change. She stated that making building\nflood proofing should be part of the regulations. She spoke about reviewing\nrequirements for new buildings and retrofitting old buildings. She suggested\nthat when distributing information to groups, maps would be a good tool. Ms.\nRasmussen stated that this is what the preparedness plan will consist of. The\nCCVA will focus the City to look at the tree canopy and what are the\nstrategies needed for a new buildings and providing flood proofing.\n\nJan Devereux, 255 Lakeview Avenue, noted her communications background and\nasked what the message is. The PowerPoint is too overwhelming to take to\nchurches and organizations, it is important not to be too alarmist. She\nsuggested speaking about events in people's life time and she stated that she\nmay not be around in 2070. She suggested using 2050. She noted that specifying\nrisk to specific populations, for example garden apartment dwellers, garbage\ncollectors, would be useful. She stated that what can be done to lessen this\nfrom happening would be more effective.\n\nAnn Durbin stated that she read the technical part of the report. It is\nimportant that the City address the health issues for infectious disease. She\nfurther stated that outreach should include talking to health practitioners.\nShe stated that workers who work outside are more vulnerable and that this\nshould be addressed.\n\nRobert Winters, 366 Broadway, stated that, basically, Alewife is a teacup. He\nspoke about the railroad and the inadequate culverts to convey water across.\nHe spoke about storm drains in the Port and Mid-Cambridge areas. He asked what\nabsolutely needs to be done. He spoke about the method that was used in\nLowell. He noted that the MBTA\u2019s flood protection plan may have worked had\npeople understood what they needed to do, but the flashboards were not used\nand Kenmore Square flooded. When the report was presented there was a focus on\nthe loss of power generation. There is a problem in Cambridge with the aging\nelectrical infrastructure, a \u201cwires in dirt\u2019 power distribution system. It\nfails during the highest load. He stated that he did not see this addressed in\nthe CCVA. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that as we move throughout the plan\nthe secondary issues such as communications will be addressed but they were\nnot part of the CCVA. He stated that he agreed with the statement about the\nelectrical infrastructure. The primary effort is new development and new\nprojects not upgrading older systems but perhaps the CCVA will help create\nleverage to improve more vulnerable existing systems. The Alewife sub-station\nis an issue and an RFP has been put out by Eversource. He spoke about\nbuildings where people can go when there is an emergency. More people are\nlooking at \u201cislanding.\u201d Ms. Rasmussen stated that low carbon energy study RFP\nwill be put out next year which may help islanding.\n\nCouncillor Kelley commented that this conversation is daunting. How can this\nbe manageable? This was flooding and heating. What happens when people cannot\ngo into their building when it is too hot? Low carbon energy RFP is tied to\nresiliency. He wanted to know that the 1500 City employees can communicate\nabout these issues. The schools need to be part of our resiliency disaster\nplanning. Councillor Carlone spoke about communications being out in a flood.\nWe do not want to over emphasize the fear.\n\nMr. Lipson stated that the Public Health Department it is about preparing for\nbad news. He spoke about FEMA duct tape instructions being silly but\nwidespread. Emphasizing evacuation is not practical; keep the message\npractical and relevant. This is not new stuff. There are lessons to be learned\nfrom incidents that have occurred. He spoke about the problem with delivering\nmedicine by the mail during Hurricane Sandy in Hoboken, NJ. The solution was\nto have a pharmacist filling prescriptions in City Hall.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he does not think that there are two years to\nthink about instances. Councillor McGovern stated he did not know what an\nevacuation plan is. Is there a set plan if there is an emergency and how is\nthe community notified. Mr. Lipson stated the Red Cross has approved\nfacilities beforehand in the event of an emergency and that the Fire\nDepartment\u2019s Emergency Planning Committee handles this.\n\nMs. Durbin asked if the City has its own radio station. She suggested having a\nhand cranked radio. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that DPW staff engages with\nother departments and lays out the plan, much as happens with snow operations.\nCouncillor Simmons suggested looking at previous plans.\n\nMegan Brooks stated that universities have enormous resources. She stated that\na crank radio is a good idea. She stated that information should also be in\npaper form to all residents.\n\nMs. Devereux stated that a communication department figures out what message\nneeds to be sent out and that perhaps less \u201cemergency communications\u201d and more\ndepartment communications would be a good idea. Ms. Rasmussen stated that\nwhere the shelters are located are unknown. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that\nLee Gianetti is the Communication Director in the Office of the City Manager\nand there are two communication specialist in Public Works. Mr. Lipson stated\nthat better communication has occurred. He noted that the City\u2019s use of social\nmedia is improving. Commissioner O'Riordan spoke about the snow emergency of\nlast year and the collaboration between Public Works and the City Manager's\noffice.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that if this is the challenge of our times better\ncommunication needs to be done.\n\nCouncillor Kelley thanked all those present for their attendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 4:34 P.M.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\nCouncillor Craig Kelley, Chair\n\nPublic Safety Committee\n\n",

   "item_id": "2161",
   "item_body": "For many years, the City of Cambridge has been committed to improving safety\nfor all users of the transportation system, particularly those users who are\nmost vulnerable. As part of this commitment, we have undertaken a wide range\nof engineering, education, and enforcement efforts aimed at reducing crashes,\nincreasing respect amongst users, and generally creating a safer and more\nequitable transportation network that meets the needs of users of all ages and\nall abilities. As a result of these efforts, we have seen an ongoing decrease\nin crash rates, as well as a reduction in the number of fatalities and serious\ninjuries. Nonetheless, even one fatality or serious injury is more than we\nwant to see, and we are continually seeking out ways to further reduce these\ntypes of incidents, and the pain and suffering they cause to individuals and\nour community at large.  \n  \nIn recent years, a number of communities-first in Europe and now increasingly\nin the United States-have begun to commit to Vision Zero, which sets a goal of\neliminating transportation fatalities and serious injuries. Vision Zero is\nboth an aspirational goal and a real goal, and we believe that in a community\nlike Cambridge, it is in fact feasible to attempt to eliminate these types of\nserious incidents, through the types of engineering, education, and\nenforcement efforts we are already undertaking, with a particular focus on the\nsafety of our system. Vision Zero provides a very helpful perspective on how\nwe improve transportation safety and the actions that we need to take to make\nthe goal a reality.  \n  \nThrough the national Vision Zero Network (www.visionzeronetwork.org\n&lt;http://www.visionzeronetwork.org&gt;), many communities have already\ncommitted to Vision Zero and have developed action plans that detail how they\nplan to achieve the elimination of transportation fatalities and serious\ninjuries (see the attached map for communities that have committed to Vision\nZero or are considering doing so). The goals and approach associated with\nVision Zero are broadly consistent with our existing approach to\ntransportation planning, design, and operations, including the following\npolicies, plans, and programs:  \n\n\u00b7 The Vehicle Trip Reduction Ordinance\n\n\u00b7 The Climate Protection Plan\n\n\u00b7 The Pedestrian Plan\n\n\u00b7 The Bicycle Plan\n\n\u00b7 The Transit Strategic Plan\n\n\u00b7 The Five-Year Street and Sidewalk Reconstruction Plan\n\n\u00b7 The Community Health Improvement Plan\n\n\u00b7 The Safe Routes to School Program\n\n\u00b7 The CitySmart Program\n\nBased on the policies and plans, we do not expect that committing to Vision\nZero will require significant new expenditures. Rather, it will create an\nenhanced focus on safety as we look at transportation problems and solutions\nthrough the lens of public health and harm reduction. In recent years, we have\ndone extensive analysis of crash statistics in Cambridge, which has given much\nimproved data about safety issues and locations where improvements are needed.\nThis data will form the basis of our Vision Zero efforts, allowing us to take\na data-driven approach to achieving the Vision Zero goal.\n\nAs City Manager, I am prepared to commit to Vision Zero, as are all of the key\nCity Departments involved in transportation, including Community Development,\nPolice, Public Health, Public Works, and Traffic, Parking, and Transportation.\nI ask that the City Council will join us in this commitment by approving the\nattached resolution and demonstrating that the City of Cambridge is fully\ncommitted to eliminating transportation fatalities and serious injuries.\n\nMap of Vision Zero Communities\n\n![](/Citizens/GetImage.aspx?Type=25&ID=/Aspose.Words.4e424409-1911-4d54-8a04-295f16f66c1b.001.png)\n\n",

Over the last nine\nmonths, the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (\u201cCRA\u201d) staff has been working\ntogether with City staff to generate a new approach for the redevelopment of\nthe Foundry after the cancellation of the Development Entity procurement\nprocess occurred in 2016. This new approach responds to interest from the\ncommunity and the City Council in evaluating how a substantially increased\ninvestment by the City and the CRA in the Foundry could facilitate expanded\ncommunity uses in the building. The CRA Board voted to approve the Plan\nAmendment at a public meeting on September 13, 2017.  \n  \nThe Plan Amendment proposes a central role for both the City and the CRA in\nthe Foundry\u2019s physical development and long-term management. The original\nDemonstration Plan called for the Development Entity that was to be retained\nby the CRA to be responsible for both the design and construction of the\nrenovations as well as for the operations and maintenance of the facility once\nthe programs were up and running. The Plan Amendment reflects a substantial\nincrease in City and CRA funding, with the design and construction process to\nbe led by the City, and with the CRA to engage an operator to manage programs,\nproperty management, and leasing. The City and the CRA will cooperate closely\nin both these efforts, as described in the document. Sections that have\nsignificant changes are Section IV.C. Demonstration Project Phases; Section\nV.B. Proposed Governance Model; Section VI. Development Entity Selection\nProcess; and Section VII. Financial Plan.  \n  \nThe City and the CRA have benefited over the last nine months from a wide\nrange of input, including a series of Foundry Advisory Committee meetings,\nmonthly discussions about the Foundry at the CRA Board meetings, City Council\nhearings, public community forums, East Cambridge Planning Team meetings, and\nmany other small group meetings. With this input, continued research into the\nbuilding\u2019s physical potential and programming opportunities, and approval by\nthe CRA Board and the City Council or the Plan Amendment, we are excited to\nembark on this new approach that we anticipate will move the redevelopment of\nthe Foundry into becoming a vibrant and vital resource for the community.\n\n",

I will initiate a\nsettlement of any such claim with the property owner if the City Council votes\nto approve these two orders and authorizes the taking of this property by\neminent domain. In the event that I successfully reach a proposed settlement\nwith the property owner to resolve such damages claim, I anticipate returning\nto the City Council in the near future with a request for a further\nappropriation which would authorize me to settle the claim and would\nconstitute a final agreed damages award to the Chamber of Commerce to pay for\nthe taking of this property.  \n  \nI look forward to discussing this matter with you and answering any questions\nthat you may have.\n\n",

Carlone\n\nCouncillor Leland Cheung\n\nCouncillor Jan Devereux\n\nCouncillor Craig Kelley\n\nCouncillor David P. Maher\n\nCouncillor Nadeem A. Mazen\n\nCouncillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr.\n\nMayor E. Denise Simmons\n\nThe Finance Committee, comprised of the entire membership of the City Council,\nconducted a public hearing on March 3, 2016 at 5:06 PM in the Ackermann Room.\n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to discuss the FY 16 budget and the FY 17\nbudget process. Vice Mayor McGovern announced that the meeting is being\nprivately audio recorded.\n\nPresent at the hearing were Vice Mayor McGovern, Chair of the Committee,\n\nCouncillor Carlone, Councillor Cheung, Councillor Kelley, Councillor Maher,\nCouncillor Mazen, Councillor Toomey, Mayor Simmons, City Manager Richard\nRossi, Deputy City Manager Lisa Peterson, Assistant City Manager for Fiscal\nAffairs Louis DePasquale, Ellen Semonoff, Assistant City Manager for Human\nService Programs, Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community\nDevelopment, Budget Director Jeana Franconi, Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor,\nRobert Haas, Commissioner of Police, Ellen Semonoff, Owen O'Riordan, Public\nWords Commissioner, Lee Gianetti, Director of Communications and Community\nRelations and City Clerk Donna P. Lopez.\n\nAlso present were John Hawkinson, 84 Massachusetts Avenue and Hasson Rashid,\n820 Massachusetts Avenue.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern opened the hearing and explained the purpose. The meeting\nwas the result of Policy Order # 9 dated January 25, 2016 (ATTACHMENT A) to\ndiscuss goals as they relate to the current budget and the FY17 budget.\n\nCity Manager Rossi spoke about the FY16 budget as it rolls into FY17 budget.\nHe stated that the preparation of the budget is a top priority for a city\nmanager as it affects the entire City. He explained that 80% of the budget\ncosts are fixed costs which is where the budget starts from. It is no secret\nthat Cambridge has high property values. All the departmental initiatives grow\nthe budget in a positive way. Policy related issues are taken into\nconsideration as well as the state budget. The budget process takes twelve\nmonths. Mr. Rossi stated that in Cambridge the budget is incredible. The\npolice, fire and human services provided in the City has come about as joint\neffort with the city manager, city departments and the community.\n\nCouncillor Cheung noted that City Council committees have goal setting\nmeetings. What is the goal of this meeting? Councillor Carlone stated that\nbecause goals were not set last term the budget is not affected. Councillor\nCheung stated that he had meetings to develop goals for his committees and\nthey roll up into the Government Operations, Rules and Claims Committee.\n\nMr. Rossi explained the process. He stated that the City Manager is\nresponsible for preparing the budget and is impacted in many ways. A goal\nsetting exercised is needed between the City Council and the City Manager. He\nstated that goals need to be broad but tell the story of where the City wants\nto go.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern gave an example. He is interested in having a shower bus\nfor the homeless and would love for Cambridge to have this. Where does he go\nfor this to be in the budget? Mr. Rossi explained that this is the type of\nthing that the City Manager and his team determine how this will be done. He\ncannot prepare a budget on the requests of nine different people; he cannot\nfund everyone's great ideas. Councillor Cheung explained his request for more\nmoney and governance for the IT budget; which took multiple years and this\ntranslated into budgetary money. Mr. Rossi stated that this needed a bigger\nprocess and this budget was increased over a long term process.\n\nCouncillor Mazen stated that the whole finance-City Manager team does a great\njob to provide a budget package. He spoke about balance between specificity\nand implementation. Mr. Rossi stated that from a policy point of view\ninitiatives will come out in the committee process rather than by a policy\norder. The IT process was a more public facing process. Councillor Mazen noted\nthat two major factors of the budget process that will indicate success. They\nare the latitude to cut spending based on discussions with the City Council to\nmake some fiscal decision moving forward and the other is that the City\nCouncil would come together to establish projects which may not be a priority\nand to take a consensus list to give guidance to the City Manager. Mr. Rossi\nstated that in the end that he has to make a decision. He added that the\npersonnel who run the city departments are the experts and he makes his budget\nbased on this input and on the input of the City Council. Councillor Mazen\nstated that if this is done as package the City Manager can tell what can be\ndone on this list. Mr. Rossi stated that this budget meets the needs of the\ncommunity.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern commented that when Plan E is questioned the system works\nbecause of the checks and balances in place. He asked how can the City Council\nhave an impact and have input into the budget process. Mr. Rossi responded\nthat the majority of the increase in the city budget comes from the City\nCouncil. He stated that the needs of the community are great.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that he felt frustrated by the budget process. The\nCity Council had little input. There is a 5-10 year plan and fixed costs due\nto salaries. He stated that more money needs to be put into affordable housing\nand that the childcare strategy makes sense. The City Council general goals is\nwhat the budget is based on and they are not very objective. Mr. Rossi noted\nthat this is within the City Council's purview. This makes it easier for the\nCity Manager to interpret. He explained that the City Manager has to have a\nbalanced budget, fill the needs and protect the City. The City Council's\nresponsibility is to adopt and approve the budget. The City Council can reject\nthe budget or add to the budget. Councillor Carlone asked if the City Council\nis really involved in the budget process. He wanted a list of infrastructure\nproject or housing projects so that he can digest this information. Mr. Rossi\nstated that the City Council is underestimating what impact the City Council\nhas in the budgetary process.\n\nCouncillor Cheung stated that this debate is around the micro versus the macro\nissues. The City Council has to ensure that the City Manager is hiring\ncompetent employees. All the micro issues will wipe out the macro issues. Mr.\nRossi spoke about a Policy Order that requires a study and the amount of work\nand time that is spent on unreal issues. He spoke about the time drain on\nemployees is hard on everyone. Councillor Cheung noted that macro stuff is\nbeing done well. He explained that he asked how to effect the IT budget and\nthat he followed the instructions given by the City Manager. The City Charter\nis set up to limit the power of the City Council and the City Council has\ndiluted power and there is currently more transparency.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern applauded the City staff and employees who work for the\ncity. He added that the City Council has to be respectful of the City\nManager's time and it is hard for an elected official to respond to a\nconstituent that they cannot help them. Mr. Rossi explained that things that\nare not feasible may not go forward.\n\nCouncillor Mazen stated that the productive tension is the balance of what is\nappropriate. The process needs flexibility and needs input from the City\nCouncil. The City Council can get behind the budget and he wanted more leeway\nto create a budget that all are happy with. City Manager Rossi stated that\nthis is not the way it works. It is his responsibility to prepare a budget.\nCouncillor Mazen suggested that the preparation of the budget with City\nCouncil input may cause delay. Mr. Rossi stated that the City Council input is\nin the goal setting session. He stated that the laws on the budget must be\nread; they are written to protect the public. He cautioned about the loss of\nstate aid. Councillor Mazen wanted consensus building so that there is input\ninto the budget and asked how the goal setting sessions make their way into\nthe budget process. Councillor Cheung informed the committee that he wanted\nparticipatory budgeting and there was a Finance Committee hearing and now\nCambridge has participatory budgeting.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that his frustration is that the goal setting\nprocess was unproductive. Mr. Rossi stated that for goal setting process the\ncity will hire a consultant to hear what the City Council wants and then the\nconsultant will have a feeling of how things were done.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern stated that the School Department has guidelines which\nlists the values that have to be in the budget. Mr. Rossi stated that this is\ndone on a departmental level all the time. Vice Mayor McGovern asked if it\nwould be more helpful if the City Council meet and listed things they wanted\nin the budget. Councillor Carlone stated that he wanted more clarity on the\nimpact. Councillor Mazen wanted to make the process easier with less pain.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern stated that Cambridge is in the envy of all other\ncommunities.\n\nCouncillor Cheung stated that he does not want to hire a consultant. The City\nCouncil can have committee hearings and report out overarching goals.\nCouncillor Mazen stated that doing this in committees has too many moving\nparts. Councillor Cheung noted that there has been consistency in finding\nmoney in the budget for emergency needs.\n\nMr. Rossi explained the process when an idea is brought to him. Councillor\nCarlone spoke about City Council consensus. Mr. Rossi stated it is a good\nidea; but it is one on a list of good ideas. Councillor Mazen spoke about\ndeveloping a patter for the City Council on what works and does not work.\nThese discussion need to be before the City Council.\n\nAt this time Assistant City Manager for Fiscal Affairs, Mr. DePasquale, gave\nan update on the FY 16. He stated that the City Council is not giving\nthemselves credit for the impact the City Council has on the budget. The\nbudget process development takes a lot of time. The budget has grown 25\npositions and it will increase in FY17. Mr. Rossi stated that this is due to\nthe increase in programing. Mitigation funds has been purposed in the\ncommunity and the money is helping nonprofits. Mr. Rossi stated that he is\nhearing that early childcare is only a City issue and he wanted the City\nCouncil to respond to this comment when they meet with the School Committee.\nHe spoke about the City initiatives created by the City Council: such as\nSTEAM, vulnerability assessment and early childcare.\n\nPublic Works Commissioner O'Riordan stated that there was a capital meeting\nheld on street reconstruction. For FY15 $8 million was allocated; this year $4\nmillion is allocated. He stated that in FY15 budget hearing heard about the\nproblem of tree wells and money was put into budget to deal with this as well\nas funding for truck barriers; street clean and recycling. Mr. Rossi added\nthat Net Zero is a big cost to the City.\n\nMs. Semonoff stated that second position was added DHSP for civic engagement.\nFunding was expanded for legal services for eviction protection and for food\npantries. She stated that Baby U was created from a request from the City\nCouncil; transitional jobs program was also grown from a City Council request.\n\nCommissioner Haas spoke about providing services for the most vulnerable and\nthis is done by collaboration with many City departments. He stated that the\nwork with youth has shown that there is a decrease in juvenile arrest. He\nspoke about the work with the elderly. Police work has been acknowledged\nnationally. He explained that 93.8% of his budget is salaries. He has two\nsocial workers on staff; this is not seen in other police departments. We are\nbuilding and working towards a healthier community.\n\nMr. Rossi spoke about the Law Department budget working to provide better\nprocess on enforcement. He added that the City Clerk's has a great computer\nsystem and will be an advanced City Clerk's Office in the years to come.\n\nAssistant City Manager for Community Development, Iram Farooq, spoke about the\n$3.3 million allocated for planning. The Net Zero process impact on the budget\nis a 25 year plan. The City Council has prioritized Planning Board\nimprovements; funding for urban design and traffic analysis. She stated that\nthe Planning Board will begin streaming their meetings. There have been\nupdates to the inclusionary zoning; regional engagement; Mayors Compact, etc.,\nHubway; bike network planning and bike racks. Mr. Rossi stated that no public\nproject is created without input from the City Council. He stated that the\nCity Council's fingerprints are all over the budget. This is a partnership and\na clear City Council message helps the administration to implement.\n\nMr. DePasquale stated that 98% of property tax bills are paid on time and the\nCity is at 99% to date. Last year there was a 16.28% increase in residential\nvalue. He spoke about the small number of application for abatements. He\nexplained that revenue is coming in strong. Departmental budgets are in good\nshape. Budget issue this year is snow expenditure of $600,000 over what was\nappropriated. The expenditure is generally around $2 million. He stated that\nthe School Department has a projected $500,000 - $700,000 deficit. These items\nwill come to the City Council for a supplemental appropriation. Mr. Rossi\nstated that the benefit level for employees has changed due to City Council\ninput. Mr. DePasquale stated that there is a $1-2 million surplus in salaries;\nhealth insurance has a surplus with a zero increase. Mr. Rossi stated that\nfree cash should never be spent down; it is the City's insurance policy\n\nMr. DePasquale gave an overview of FY17 budget. The School Department has the\nbiggest gap; and the gap is closing without affecting the students. There is a\n5.5% projected tax levy increase at the start of the process for FY17. He\nspoke about the modest tax levy increase. Water rates have had a zero increase\nfor 5-6 years; sewer rates a 3.2% increase and it may go up greater this year.\nCity is growing and the City needs to keep an eye on the budget and property\ntax increases.\n\nCouncillor Carlone thanked Vice Mayor McGovern for convening this hearing.\nVice Mayor McGovern added that he will have a hearing on the goals.\n\nAt 6:29 PM Vice Mayor McGovern opened the hearing to public comment.\n\nMr. Rashid stated that there is not enough money in the budget for the\nhomeless.\n\nAt 6:30 PM public comment was closed.\n\nCouncillor Cheung encouraged the City Manager to have the City Council\ncommittees hold hearings on the goals. He suggested having ideas held in a\nholding meeting for all new ideas.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern stated that after the Roundtable/working meeting with the\nSchool Committee on March 28, 2016 he wanted to hold smaller hearings with the\nCity Council and the School Committee to have questions answered before the\nbudget hearing so that the budget hearing is on budget items rather than\ncurriculum issues. Mr. Rossi stated that departments are already executing\ntheir plan and when the City Council throws another program in it is\ndifficult.\n\nCouncillor Mazen stated that it is important to address homelessness. It is\nunfair to say that nothing is done and that government does not have the\namount of resources to address this issue. He stated that the problem is\nlarge. Vice Mayor McGovern spoke about the departmental services that have\nhelped homelessness.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern thanked all attendees.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 6:39 PM. on a motion by Councillor Cheung. .\n\n![](/Citizens/GetImage.aspx?Type=25&ID=/Aspose.Words.6a2297b3-843e-40f9-90e2-6dd5c0f66da1.001.png)\n\n5\n\n",

   "item_body": "Listed below are the recommendations of the Community Preservation Act\nCommittee (CPAC) for FY2017. For additional information, please see\nattachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Lisa Peterson, dated September 19,\n2016.  \n  \nThe CPA process began with a public meeting held on June 15, 2016, to solicit\nsuggestions on CPA projects for FY2017. Based on that meeting and other\ninputs, the CPAC was provided information on project funding requests without\nany recommendations for percentage allocations of anticipated CPA funds. A\npublic hearing was held on July 28, 2016, to solicit recommendations from the\npublic on percentage allocations. The CPAC also received several petitions,\nletters and e-mails along with online project requests from the public\nrelative to CPA recommendations. The CPAC, on September 7, 2016, unanimously\nvoted for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historical\nPreservation Projects and 10% for Open Space Projects.  \n  \nIn accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City\nCouncil appropriate a total of $12,310,000 in CPA funds raised by the City's\nFY2017 CPA surcharge, the FY2016 state match funds received in FY2017 and a\nportion of the existing CPA fund balance.  \n  \nFor this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the\nCPA surcharge for FY2017 will total $8,600,000, with an additional state match\nof approximately $1,600,000. In addition, $2,100,000 from CPA Fund Balance is\nbeing recommended for appropriation, plus an additional $10,000 from the Fund\nBalance for annual membership dues to the Community Preservation Coalition.  \n  \nOn September 7, 2016, the CPAC made recommendations for allocation of these\nFY2017 funds. By unanimous votes, the CPAC recommended to the City Council,\nthrough the City Manager, that the CPA funds be allocated and appropriated as\nfollows:  \n  \nRecommended FY 2017 Allocation and Appropriation of CPA Funds  \n  \nVOTE 1: Fiscal Year 2017 Local Funds ($8,600,000)\n\n##### Vote 1A\n\n80% of FY2017 CPA Local Fund revenues ($6,880,000) allocated to Affordable\nHousing and appropriated to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust.  \n  \nVote 1B  \n10% of FY2017 CPA Local Fund revenues ($860,000) allocated to Historic\nPreservation as follows:\n\n1. $600,000  appropriated to the Historic Preservation Grants\n\n2. $100,000 appropriated to the Magazine Beach Powderhouse interior rehab\n\n3. $150,000  appropriated to the Brattle Street bluestone sidewalk restoration\n\n4. $10,000 appropriated to the Magazine Beach signage\n\n###### Vote 1C\n\n10% of FY2017 CPA Local Fund revenues ($860,000) allocated to Open Space as\nfollows:\n\n1. $500,000 appropriated to the Graham and Parks School Playground \n\n2. $250,000 appropriated to the Fresh Pond Parkway Community Garden\n\n3. $110,000 appropriated to Sennott Park \n\nVOTE 2: Fiscal Year 2016 State Funds [received in FY2017] ($1,600,000)\n\n##### Vote 2A\n\n80% of FY2016 State Match revenues ($1,280,000) allocated to Affordable\nHousing and appropriated to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust.\n\n###### Vote 2B\n\n10% of FY2016 State Match revenues ($160,000) allocated to Historic\nPreservation as follows:\n\n1. $6,600 appropriated to Magazine Beach signage\n\n2. $60,000 appropriated to the Lowell Park landscape plan\n\n3. $30,000 appropriated to Old Burying Ground, headstone and table tomb restoration\n\n4. $63,400 appropriated to the City Clerk vault construction\n\n##### Vote 2C\n\n10% of FY2016 State Match revenues ($160,000) allocated to Open Space as\nfollows:\n\n1. $160,000 appropriated to Sennott Park\n\n  \nVOTE 3: CPA Fund Balance ($2,100,000)\n\n##### Vote 3A\n\n80% of the Fund Balance ($1,680,000) allocated to Affordable Housing and\nappropriated to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust.\n\nVote 3B\n\n10% of the Fund Balance ($210,000) allocated to Historic Preservation as\nfollows:\n\n1. $200,000 appropriated to the City Clerk vault construction\n\n2. $10,000 appropriated to the preservation scanning of city directories\n\nVote 3C\n\n10% of the Fund Balance ($210,000) allocated to Open Space as follows:\n\n1. $210,000 appropriated to Sennott Park\n\n  \nVOTE 4: CPA Fund Balance - Administration ($10,000)\n\nVote 4A\n\n1. $10,000 appropriated to Administrative Costs for Community Preservation Coalition Membership Dues.\n\nTable 1.

This update was prepared with staff\nand community input and has been reviewed and approved by the Massachusetts\nEmergency Management Agency (MEMA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency\n(FEMA). The plan was funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s\n(FEMA) Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) Grant Program.\n\nPlanning for the Cambridge Hazard Mitigation Plan 2015 Update was led by the\nCambridge Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee. This committee discussed\nwhere the impacts of natural hazards most affect the City, goals for\naddressing these impacts, and hazard mitigation measures that would benefit\nthe City.\n\nThe Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 requires all municipalities that\nwish to be eligible to receive FEMA funding for hazard mitigation grants, to\nadopt a local multi-hazard mitigation plan and update this plan in five year\nintervals.\n\nNatural hazard mitigation planning is the process of determining how to\nsystematically reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property damage\nresulting from natural hazards such as floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes\nthrough long-term strategies. These long-term strategies include planning,\npolicy changes, programs, projects, and other activities.\n\nFlooding, driven by hurricanes, northeasters, and other storms, clearly\npresents the greatest hazard to the City of Cambridge, most especially in\nlocations that are low-lying or where drainage and conveyance systems can be\noverwhelmed during storm events with significant precipitation.\n\nAttached is the Executive Summary of the 2015 Hazard Mitigation Plan.

After discussion by the\nCouncil at the August 1, 2016 meeting, PLL\u2019s request was referred back to me\nwith a request to provide the Council further information regarding the\nrequest. In response to the Council\u2019s request for additional information,\nplease find the following supplemental information.\n\n  \nPLL has provided the attached (2) color renderings as well as an architectural\nelevation drawing which show the placement and signage for the proposed canopy\nas well as the street scape. PLL states that two (2) new trees are being\nplanted on Harvard Street along the property\u2019s frontage. In response to the\nCouncil\u2019s inquiry regarding how this canopy fits into the neighborhood, PLL\nstates that the name of the building, \u201cPort Landing\u201d was chosen to reflect its\nconnection to community following the Council\u2019s renaming Area 4 to the \u201cPort.\u201d\nPLL states that this is the only 100% affordable housing development being\nconstructed in the City this year.\n\nAs further background, PLL states that the sign that is proposed for the\ncanopy was reviewed by the City\u2019s Community Development Department (\u201cCDD\u201d)\npursuant to Article 7.000 of Cambridge Zoning Ordinance governing \u201cSigns and\nIllumination.\u201d In addition, PLL represents that this project has been the\nsubject of four (4) neighborhood meetings over the course of four (4) years.\nPLL also states that it sought and obtained a variance from the Cambridge\nBoard of Zoning Appeal for setback and FAR relief for this development.\n\nAs was set forth in the applicant\u2019s August 1, 2016 application, the structural\ncanopy will overhang a portion of the City-owned sidewalk along Harvard Street\nlocated along PLL\u2019s property located at 131 Harvard Street (the \u201cProperty\u201d).\nPLL has agreed that there will be no illuminated signs installed on the canopy\nstructure.\n\nThe dimensions of the canopy structure in front of the Property on Harvard\nStreet will be approximately 41\u2019 feet wide by 2.5\u2019 feet deep. The top of the\ncanopy structure will be approximately 14.5\u2019 feet above the sidewalk. The\ntotal weight of the canopy structure is estimated at 1,800 pounds and is part\nof the second floor structural wood frame that spans the width of the\nbuilding. I have attached a plan and renderings of the proposed canopy\nstructure.\n\nThe total requested license area is one thousand four hundred and eighty five\ncubic feet (1,485 cu. ft.). The requested license area is depicted in the\n\u201cLicense Plan of Land\u201d attached hereto. The Director of Assessing has\ndetermined the annual fee for Fiscal Year 2017 shall be $1,039.00 which shall\nbe subject to annual increases.\n\nIn accordance with the Cambridge Municipal Code, the plans and renderings have\nbeen reviewed by various City departments (Police, Fire, Water, CDD, Public\nWorks (including the City Engineer), Electrical, and Traffic, Parking and\nTransportation). I deemed it appropriate to transmit this license request to\nthe City Council for its consideration pursuant to Section 12.12.200. Section\n12.12.200 allows for the maintenance over the public way of a structural\ncanopy when a permit therefor has been authorized by the City Council. I\nbelieve that the information furnished in this letter is sufficient to enable\nthe City Council to make a determination on this matter.\n\nI recommend that the City Council vote to authorize me to grant a license, in\nsuch form and substance as I deem appropriate, for the installation of a\nstructural canopy at this location.\n\n",

   "item_description": " A communication transmitted from Richard C. Rossi, City Manager, relative to the block rates for water consumption and sewer use for the period beginning April 1, 2016 and ending March 31, 2017.",
   "item_id": "2166",
   "item_body": "RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe City administration and City Council continue to recognize the importance\nof minimizing increases in water and sewer rates. I recommend that the City\nCouncil approve a 0% increase in the water consumption block rate and a 3.2%\nincrease in the sewer use block rate, resulting in a 2.4% increase in the\ncombined rate for the period beginning April 1, 2016 and ending March 31,\n2017. This is the sixth consecutive year that the City has been able to\nproduce a 0% increase in the water rate.  \n  \nIn last year\u2019s recommendation, the projected FY17 rate increases for water,\nsewer, and combined were 3.1%, 7.7%, and 6.4%, respectively, based on March\n2015 consumption rates and projected budgets. We have been able to produce\nrates lower than estimated due primarily to lower operating budget projections\nin the Water Budget, and lower projected Massachusetts Water Resources\nAuthority (MWRA) assessments in the Sewer Budget. The MWRA provides annual\nupdates to their projected assessments.  \n  \nIn March of each year, the City Council establishes water and sewer rates,\nwhich determine water and sewer revenues for the next fiscal year. Because of\nthe timing requirements, water and sewer rates are set prior to the adoption\nof both the Cambridge budget and MWRA budget; therefore, revenue needs are\nbased upon estimated expenditures. Historically, water and sewer rates have\nbeen established so that revenues generated by them, when combined with other\nrelated revenue sources, cover projected annual costs.\n\nWATER\n\nTwo major factors determine the rate necessary to generate sufficient\nrevenues: water consumption and the budget. The total FY17 Water Budget\nreflects a $108,815 increase from FY16. Water is able to offset costs related\nto cost-of-living allowances, pensions, and health benefits in the salaries\nand wages portion of the operating budget with a decrease in debt service\npayments.\n\nThe planned FY17 capital allocation is $5,000,000 using pay-as-you-go capital\nfunding based on current revenues ($3,500,000) and fund balance ($1,500,000).\nThe major project in the FY17 budget is the second phase of the installation\nof variable frequency drives (VFDs) to the raw water pump system. An\nadditional $1,000,000 million has been included for the replacement of\nexisting VFDs on the finished water pumps. Installation of the VFDs will\nsubstantially improve energy efficiency at the water treatment plant. The\ntotal project cost is $5,000,000 over two years, of which $3,000,000 was\nfunded from fund balance. The remainder of the FY17 capital allocation will be\nused for improvements to the distribution and transmission system, treatment\nplant equipment replacement, consulting services, and improvements to the\nwatershed. Table 4 on page 5 indicates the details of water fund projected\nrevenues and expenditures for FY16-21. Table 7 on page 8 shows actual water\nfund balances for FY11-15 and the projected balance for FY16.  \n  \nTo support a 0% water rate increase for the sixth year, $350,000 from fund\nbalance will be used in FY17, bringing the total fund balance used to\n$1,850,000. We expect to eliminate the use of the fund balance in FY18, as\ndecreases in debt service continue and as long as water consumption remains\nconstant.  \n  \n\nWater and sewer charges are directly linked to water consumption, with sewer\ncosts comprising approximately 71.2% of total water and sewer expenditures.\nWhen consumption declines, revenues are negatively impacted. In the current\nfiscal year, water is being consumed at a rate similar to the previous fiscal\nyear. If this trend continues, this would be the second year in which\nconsumption has not decreased.\n\n####\n\n#### SEWER\n\nThe FY17 sewer budget reflects a 6.0% increase from FY16. This includes the\nMWRA assessment, debt service payments, and the sewer component of the Public\nWorks budget. Debt service on sewer bonds and the MWRA assessment account for\n90.2% of the total Sewer Budget.  \n  \nFY17 estimated sewer revenues will cover the FY17 estimated MWRA assessment,\nwhich is scheduled to increase by $639,184 from the FY16 final assessment. The\nMWRA rate increase projected for the City is subject to change based on the\nMWRA budget, which is adopted later in spring 2016. These changes have\ntypically been minor in past years. Unlike the water budget, sewer revenues\nare credited to the general fund and not to a separate proprietary fund that\ncan be drawn upon if the need arises.  \n  \nIncluded in the sewer budget are debt service increases attributable to the\n$12,740,000 general obligation bonds issued in February 2016 and the February\n2016 SRF loan for Concord Avenue for $14,000,000.  \n  \nThe following sewer projects were included in the February 2016 bond issue:\nCherry Street / South Massachusetts Avenue; Alewife Watershed; and Harvard\nSquare projects.  \n  \nThe FY17 capital allotment of $1,000,000 in sewer revenues will continue to\nfinance the remedial reconstruction program and development.  \n  \nThe City Council has authorized significant investments in the water and sewer\nsystems to ensure Cambridge continues to benefit from a healthy and\nenvironmentally sound water and sewer system. In addition to the projects\ncurrently under way, the City\u2019s five-year capital plan (FY17-21) calls for an\nadditional investment of approximately $135,663,000 (primarily sewer,\n$114,663,000) in the water and sewer systems. The City carefully monitors the\nissuance of debt to fund authorized sewer projects and makes adjustments to\nensure that debt service cost increases, which impact the sewer rate, are\nmoderate.  \n  \nSubsidies from the SRF loan program will cover only $44,240 or 0.2% of the\ntotal debt service of $19,942,737 for all FY17 sewer projects. The City will\ncontinue to receive state subsidies on existing debt. The FY18-21 capital plan\nincludes other projects that may be eligible for subsidized loans from the\nstate. As in past years, it is not certain that these projects will receive\nstate subsidies and the debt service on these projects has been calculated\nbased on funding through general obligation bonds. If state subsidies become\navailable to the City, they will be used to lower the sewer rate in future\nyears. Table 5 on page 6 shows the detail of sewer-related expenditures and\nrevenues for FY16-21.\n\nCOMBINED WATER &amp; SEWER\n\nThe table below reflects the projected combined water and sewer metered\nrevenue requirements needed to cover water and sewer expenditures.\n\nTABLE 1\n\n|\n\nFY16 Projected\n\n|\n\nFY17 Budget\n\n|\n\n% Change  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \nWater\n\n|\n\n$17,135,000\n\n|\n\n$17,137,015\n\n|\n\n0.0%  \n  \nSewer\n\n|\n\n$46,350,000\n\n|\n\n$47,844,595\n\n|\n\n3.2%  \n  \nCombined Water / Sewer Revenue\n\n|\n\n$63,485,000\n\n|\n\n$64,981,610\n\n|\n\n2.4%  \n  \nFY17 projected revenues are based on FY16 projected collections and reflect\nour practice of conservative revenue projections.\n\nThe table below reflects the FY16 actual and FY17 proposed water and sewer\nrates.\n\nTABLE 2\n\n|\n\n|\n\n##\n\n## Annual Consumption*\n\n|\n\nFY16\n\nWater\n\nRate\n\n|\n\nFY17\n\nProposed Water Rate\n\n|\n\nFY16\n\nSewer\n\nRate\n\n|\n\nFY17\n\nProposed Sewer Rate  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n## Block 1\n\n|\n\n0 \u2013 40 CcF\n\n|\n\n$3.02\n\n|\n\n$3.02\n\n|\n\n$9.21\n\n|\n\n$9.50  \n  \nBlock 2\n\n|\n\n41 \u2013 400 CcF\n\n|\n\n$3.24\n\n|\n\n$3.24\n\n|\n\n$9.74\n\n|\n\n$10.05  \n  \nBlock 3\n\n|\n\n401 \u2013 2,000 CcF\n\n|\n\n$3.44\n\n|\n\n$3.44\n\n|\n\n$10.46\n\n|\n\n$10.79  \n  \nBlock 4\n\n|\n\n2,001 \u2013 10,000 CcF\n\n|\n\n$3.65\n\n|\n\n$3.65\n\n|\n\n$11.26\n\n|\n\n$11.62  \n  \nBlock 5\n\n|\n\nOver 10,000 CcF\n\n|\n\n$3.96\n\n|\n\n$3.96\n\n|\n\n$11.97\n\n|\n\n$12.35  \n  \n*All rates are per CcF.

To qualify for the 30% discount, a\nhomeowner must be 65 or older and must have been granted the Clause 41C\nelderly real estate exemption. For FY16, the income guidelines are as follows:\nsingle, income of $25,197 with assets of $50,392 or less; married, income of\n$37,796 with assets of $69,289 or less.\n\n# FUTURE OUTLOOK FOR RATES\n\nOverall, the City has been extremely successful over the past five years in\nproducing minimal water and sewer rate increases. The average annual increases\nfor the FY12-16 period were as follows: water, 0.0%; sewer, 3.2%; and\ncombined, 2.3%, which include both the water and sewer rates showing 0%\nincreases in FY12 and FY13. The FY14, FY15 and FY16 water rate increase was\nalso 0%.\n\nTables 4, 5, 6 and 7 contain five-year forecasts for water, sewer, and\ncombined revenue estimates as well as water fund balances for the past five\nyears and the projected FY16 fund balance. Although the City currently does\nnot project the use of fund balance in the out years, it will continue to\nreview appropriate use of fund balance for a specific project, or to lower the\nrate. As can be seen in Table 6, the annual combined water / sewer rate is\nprojected to increase by an average of approximately 5.2% for FY17-21. The\nprojected increase is the result of the City\u2019s commitment to bonding sewer\ninfrastructure improvement projects and increases in the MWRA assessment\n(based on estimates received from the MWRA). MWRA increases are projected to\nbe 1.4% - 7.1% in FY17-FY21. If increases in the MWRA assessment are more\nmoderate, the rate increases that are shown will be lowered. If consumption\nincreases and therefore revenues increase, rate increases will be affected\npositively. Conversely, if consumption decreases, there will be a negative\neffect on water and sewer revenues.\n\nOur water and sewer program is structured to produce reasonable rate increases\nin the future. The goal of the City Administration and City Council is to\nminimize the effects of water and sewer rate increases on residents as much as\npossible, while continuing to invest in our infrastructure.\n\n",

The site was also a landfill prior to the school\nand ballfield use. The Tobin School property currently has an activity and use\nlimitation (AUL) which allows continued normal use of the school building and\ngrounds, but restricts access to the soil and groundwater beneath the site at\ndepths greater than three feet below ground surface.  \n  \nAs part of the process to redevelop the Tobin and Vassal Lane Upper Schools, a\nConcept Plan of a school layout shall be performed to assess if it is possible\nto construct a new school campus over the current Callahan Field immediately\nadjacent to the existing school building, along Concord Avenue. If located on\nthe field this construction would take place while the Tobin School is in use.\nNo decisions have been made on this option, however geotechnical and\nenvironment services are required to evaluate both siting options. These\nservices will provide data to for future designer (architect) to evaluate both\nsite options during a future Feasibility Study.  \n  \nGenerally, data will be collected by drilling test borings at key locations on\nthe site, and shall include installation of groundwater monitoring wells to\ncharacterize and evaluate impacted groundwater and to establish seasonal water\nelevation fluctuations. Environmental soil and groundwater analytical samples\nwill be collected to evaluate the challenges of removal and/or capping of\nwaste materials, and to evaluate how to remediate groundwater issues related\nto vapor intrusion during active construction and dewatering activities. It is\nanticipated that work will be completed by mid-year 2018.  \n\n  \nThis work is required to move the Tobin School project forward. By having\ncomplete geotechnical and environmental information, it will allow the City to\nmake informed decisions on all possible building options for the site.\n\n",

He stated\nthat the public process was limited and this petition came about after\ndiscussions with the community and his neighbors. He explained that this\npetition began two years ago. He stated that basement apartments are low\nhanging fruit. He stated that families are faced with difficult decisions of\nbeing over or under-housed. If the petition is adopted as written, housing\nunits will be created. He stated that the current zoning has accessory\nhousing. He stated that the City is constantly looking to increase housing.\nThis is done by density. He stated that the Harvard Defense Fund submitted a\nsimilar petition previously. He stated that there is a significant housing for\nlarge houses. Opportunities across the City can be found to create accessory\nuses. A variance is currently required to do this. He stated that the Master\nPlan for the City and none of the studies will say less housing is needed. The\nMaster Plan wants to preserve the neighborhoods. He had a list of amendments.\nHe stated that the Planning Board had difficulty distinguishing two family\nhouses to allow this. The two family caveat is eliminated. This may be\nsomething for the Master Plan to decide. The proposed changes are outlined in\nthe maps (ATTACHMENT C-1 - C-3); the red are additional units; 1007 additional\nunits will be created without changing the contextual, construction of what is\nexisting. He stated that Part A and Part B effects both sides of the City.\nThis amendment should be used as a tool. He discussed areas that were issues\nfor the Planning Board. He did not want to create an administrative burden and\nhe suggested eliminating the affidavit provision. The last portion refers to\nPart A. He stated that there is no long term effect on neighborhoods and\nparking which were concerns for residents and the Planning Board. The map\nshows where accessory units will be allowed. He eliminated the requirement for\nparking for accessory units because a special permit is required for parking.\nThis purpose of this petition was to create homes and give flexibility to\nhomeowners. This petition gives something to homeowners. He stated that a\nsuggested amendment is that parking is added and could be eliminated by a\nspecial permit. He stated that Part B eliminates GFA space above six feet for\na single or two family homes by as of right or special permit. He noted that\nmany basements have illegal uses. He stated that the Building, Sanitary and\nMunicipal Ordinance do not line up. He stated that under the Building Code\ncurrently in a single or two family home it allowed finishing off a basement\nat 6'8\" or greater. Depending on the FAR a variance or special permit may be\nrequired. He is suggesting that for single and two family homes it is allowed.\nHe is trying to create parity. He stated that in the Sanitary Code spaces that\nare 6'11\" or lower are not livable or habitable. The Municipal Ordinance lines\nup with 6\"11\" GFA. He stated that eliminating height in basement units does\nnot make sense. He stated that there are many units that are unknown by ISD or\nthe Fire Department that are not up to code and are potential hazards. This\ncreates underground units. He asked for allowance for people to use these\nspaces and bring them up to code. He stated that the biggest issue is flooding\nand there are areas in the City where this cannot be done, but this will still\nbe an issue for a 6'11\" basement. He included that this should be allowed in\nlarge commercial spaces. He stated that he owns the property where Toscanni's\nis located and has used basement space for 30 years and now it is a kitchen.\nHe noted that basement spaces are being used. He stated that if the City is\nlooking to find creative ways to use space to rezone a large are to allow\nadditional structure there is already existing basement space that can be\nused. He suggested in his amendment that the special permit provision be\neliminated. He stated that there are open space, set back and height\nrequirements that prevent building throughout the City. These will still\ncontrol what is able to be used and Article 8 would still apply. This is a way\nto create parity for a proposal that has not received support over the years.\nHe explained part B. He stated let us use this space, know where these spaces\nare, what they are being used for and tax the property. We are taking existing\nspace and use it more effectively, preserve the neighborhood, and help\nfamilies.\n\nJeff Roberts noted that the Planning Board heard this petition on October 27,\n2015 and recommended that the petition needed further study. An advance copy\nof the Planning Board recommendation which will be on the agenda for the\nNovember 23rd City Council was distributed (ATTACHMENT D). Mr. Roberts stated\nthat the Planning Board felt that there were some good points to the petition\nsuch as using the existing housing stock with more flexibility, but felt that\nthere were aspect of the proposal that needed further study. Accessory units\noperate in a full set of zoning requirements and development controls and that\nthe challenge be looked at in a comprehensive way and be considered in the\ncity-wide process and establish goals and objectives.\n\nCouncillor McGovern asked if the amendments submitted last night to the City\nCouncil address the Planning Board concerns. Mr. Roberts stated that this is\nthe first time he has seen proposed changes and cannot comment.\n\nVice Mayor Benzan opened public comment at 2:46 PM.\n\nMarilee Meyer, 10 Dana Street stated that she was lost in the details. Her\nimpression is that the petition is a city-wide up zoning for properties that\nmay or may not be appropriate. The Planning Board stated that this is not\nready for prime time and is not directed at affordable housing. Mid-Cambridge\nis the most dense neighborhood but Mr. Barrett is talking about West\nCambridge. This is encouraging infill with some of these properties. She\nstated that parking, entries to the unit, windows and window wells, density,\nnoise and regulations and utilities are concerns. She spoke about the\nrequirement of the Historical Commission regarding foundations. She did not\nwant the historical character of the neighborhood lost. This petition benefits\nthe petitioner.\n\nDoug Brown, 35 Standish Street, signed the petition and it is a valid way to\nget more housing. He agreed with the amendments proposed and limits unintended\nconsequences. He stated people live in sub-standard spaces, have to follow the\nexpensive variances or do the changes illegally. He stated that not every\naccessory unit will benefit or vice versa some additional living space may be\nsought and may be in a basement or attic. Regarding the historical\nsignificance these requirements and rules still apply; approval from\nHistorical Commission is still required. He stated most houses are already\nover on the FAR and when all the requirements are added in not much is left.\nHe supports this proposal and urged the City Council to pass it.\n\nCarol O'Hare, 172 Magazine Street, stated that a major amendment has been\nproposed and reached the City Council last night and did not get circulated\nahead of time. She stated that owner occupied amendment was amended from the\noriginal petition would be dropped. She objected to the initial owner occupied\naccessory apartment because there was no mechanism to ensure owner occupancy\nwould continue if the house was sold. This should continue longer than the\noriginal owner occupancy provision. This amendment was not filed and due to\nthis amendment being major this process needs to start over again. She\nsubmitted her comments (ATTACHMENT E). She spoke of the exclusion of the\nliving space from the FAR for residential units that are not accessory units\nwould apply to new and existing construction. The special permit process is\nnot the place to rezone basement space throughout the city. There should be a\nuniform way to decide this in zoning. This amendment is right for the Master\nPlanning process or the amendment should begin the process again.\n\nPebble Gifford 15 Hilliard Street, stated that she has an accessory apartment\nthat was grandfathered. She stated that there are problems with this petition.\nShe suggested that each zoning district should be reviewed as to how this\nwould work. She stated that it is ill advised to rezone the entire City with a\nbroad brush as this proposal does. She was involved in drafting the original\naccessory apartment ordinance in 1970. No changes could be made to the\nenvelope of the building. Parking was a requirement and had to be owner\noccupied house and provide some income to fix the house. This has worked in a\nlimited way. She stated that you need a separate means of egress which is\nexpensive. She suggested looking at this in a district by district way and not\ncity-wide. Low income housing should be addressed in the Master Plan. She\nstated that groups cannot be discriminated against such as a group of students\nliving in these units.\n\nAmy Munsat, 71 Standish Street, stated that she is an architectural designer.\nShe stated that for over 25 years she has seen situations where people are\nstruggling to stay in their homes. There is an existing housing stock and this\nis a way to allow flexibility to redesign their spaces that fits them at where\nthey are in their lives. This addresses numerous issues including aging in\nplace, addresses sustainability and livable space and adds income to families.\nShe stated that so many people could take advantage of this.\n\nJan Devereux, 255 Lakeview Avenue, signed the petition last summer and agreed\nwith the flexibility intent to owners to the existing housing stock. She\nstated that some of the amendments are acceptable. She stated that the\nadditional 623 units is a limited impact because of the burden to create the\nseparate egress and having the capital to do this. Only half of this number\nmay actually benefit which is a small number of units. She added that the\ncurrent accessory housing ordinance does not require that it be owner\noccupied.\n\nJames Williamson 1000 Jackson Place, spoke about flooding which is a\nsignificant issue. He suggested taking a look at where flooding would be a\nproblem. Height may be an issue, unit size, livability and minimum square\nfootage. He likes the theory of low and moderate income people being able to\ndo something to remain in their homes. Protecting the affordability of the\nunits is a conundrum. Neighborhood density and parking are issues. He stated\nthat there are complexities with this. He agreed with the Planning Board on\nthis.\n\nAt this time Councillor Carlone assumed the chair.\n\nStephen Kaiser, 191 Hamilton, a homeowner of a three decker since 1972. The\ndiscussion is for one or two family houses. He stated that if he paints his\nhouse he can have low rents. His primary concerns are flooding and basements.\nHe stated that no study has been done by the proponent about the flood levels\nand storms. He agreed with the Planning Board recommendation. He stated that\nin July 2010 there was 4 inches of rain in 70 minutes. As a result the Public\nWorks building and the Somerville Fire station were flooded. This is a\npractical concern and it is not addressed in the petition. He is more in\nopposition. He spoke about destabilization of neighborhoods. If this were\npassed it would result in high cost renovations and it would lead to high\nrents and Cambridge cannot lose low and moderate income housing. He stated\nthat the proposal needs further study. He urged the City Council not to pass\nthe proposal. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT F).\n\nWayne Bingham, Cedar Street, stated that there is construction on each side of\nhis house and the children are being woken up at 7 AM. He asked why there must\nbe development taking place on every square inch of land in Cambridge. He\nasked is the City pro-developer or pro-neighborhood. He stated that the\nneighborhoods are gone.\n\nTony Madan stated that this is a way to get affordable housing. He spoke about\nthe rents charged for a basement apartment compared to a sunny upper floor\napartment. This will be an incentive for landlords being property up to code.\n\nPublic comment closed at 3:27 PM on motion of Councillor Carlone.\n\nVice Mayor Benzan assumed the Chair and asked the pleasure of the City\nCouncil.\n\nCouncillor McGovern spoke about historical concerns and flooding issues will\nthere be a process to approve what gets built. Mr. Barrett stated that this is\nto align the Building, Sanitary and Municipal Codes. All approvals will be\nneeded in order to build. He stated single and two family houses can be\nrenovated at 6'11\" without a special permit. He stated that you want ISD\ninspectors to look at these units. He stated that some properties are not\nallowed to do this. He stated that basements could be renovated but not be\naccessory space. Councillor McGovern stated that height and density are\nissues. This is a way to create affordable units and a way to let family\nmembers, seniors and students stay in their homes. People who want to live\nclose to their work want to live in the City. He wanted assurance that these\nunits would be low income units. Mr. Barrett states that there is no owner\noccupied required in the accessory apartment. He stated that if you want to\ncreate accessory units for low income residents you can, but it is not his\nintention. He wants to create flexibility and more housing for everyone, not\njust affordable housing.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the thrust of proposal makes sense. He\nsuggested above garages as added living space. Scandinavian countries build in\nthe attic and add elevators especially for the elderly. He stated that this\nwould make sense in some instances and not in others. He spoke about using a\nFrench drain for moisture in basements. He stated that renovations needed\ncould be expensive and this is where the rents may be effected. The premise\nmakes sense. The Planning Board recommendation that this be part of the Master\nPlan makes sense and getting it right makes sense.\n\nMayor Maher stated the petition shows the creativity for housing and access to\nhousing. He stated that basement overlay district was done last term along\nMass. Avenue from the Cambridge Common to Porter Square. We are seeing what\ncan be done in these apartments. Mr. Roberts outlined the projects that are\nongoing. Mayor Maher stated that there is a provision about the flood zone\nthat the Public Works Commissioner has to sign off if the units are in a flood\nzone. This has merit and he is grateful that this was brought forward. There\nis an opportunity to continue to look at this and have adapted the\nrecommendation. Mr. Barrett stated that PART A and B are different. The\naccessory apartment part could be brought into the Master Plan process but the\nPart B does not need study by the Master Plan. He is talking about freedom and\nflexibility to use space in a safe, legal way.\n\nVice Mayor Benzan commended Mr. Barrett. How do we prevent a sell-off of\nsingle and two family homes? Mr. Barrett stated that the inclusion of two\nfamily structures complicates this proposal and he included two family units\nto create units. Mr. Barrett stated that in his original proposal he included\nownership affidavit. The current ordinance does not require any chain of\nownership.\n\nCouncillor Toomey moved that the matter be referred to the full City Council\nwithout recommendation. The motion carried on a voice vote of five members.\n\nThe following e-mail was received and made part of the report:\n\nCommunication from Carole Perrault stated that the petition is not ready for\nprime time and its impact on historical and architectural character of\nneighborhoods needs to be thoroughly understood (ATTACHMENT G).\n\nVice Mayor Benzan thanked all those present for their attendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 3:52 PM.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n__________________________________\n\nCouncillor Dennis J.

Denise Simmons  \n  \nCall to Order\n\nThe City Council held a public hearing on Wednesday, February 24, 2016\nbeginning at 5:30 P.M. in the Sullivan Chamber.\n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to conduct a public hearing to discuss a zoning\npetition filed by Peter L. Cohen, et al to amend the Zoning Ordinance to\nrestrict garage development in dimensionally non-conforming lots.\n\nPresent at the hearing were Mayor Simmons, Councillor Devereux, Vice Mayor\nMcGovern, Councillor Mazen, Councillor Cheung Councillor Kelley, Councillor\nMaher, Councillor\n\nToomey, Jeff Roberts, Zoning and Land Use Planner, Community Development\nDepartment (CDD) and City Clerk Donna P. Lopez.\n\nAlso present were Peter Cohen, 11 Donnell Street, Charlie Teague, 23 Edmonds\nStreet,\n\nMayor Simmons presided at the hearing due to Council Committees not being\napproved. She convened the hearing and explained the purpose. She outlined the\nformat of the hearing. She noted that if comments were submitted by e-mail\nthat they would be made part of the record. She then invited the petitioner to\ncome forward.\n\nPetition\n\nThe City Council heard from the petitioner, Mr. Peter L. Cohen, 11 Donnell\nStreet. He stated that he wanted to amend the zoning ordinance in a very\nmodest way that is important to him and his family. He spoke about his\nneighborhood. The neighborhood contains modest two family houses, a few single\nfamily houses and a few triple deckers. His neighbors are friendly, but not\nintrusive. There is a sense of neighborhood. There are young families with\nchildren in the neighborhood. He noted that the scale and architecture of the\nhomes in the neighborhood are located close to and face the street. Most homes\nhave off street parking and there are a few garages which are separate\nstructures tucked behind the homes. He stated that the exceptions are 10 and\n12 Donnell Street have garages that were built into the main structure facing\nthe street in a townhouse style. He further stated that 7B and 7C Donnell\nStreet have a garage facing the street as part of the condominium structure\nbut is located down a driveway and 50 feet from the street. He explained that\nin his residential neighborhood there are no residential units, old or new,\nwith a garage facing the street. He did not want the urban landscape to change\nexcept when there is a compelling reason. He explained why this is an issue to\nbuild a structure where the main feature facing the street is a garage.\nEconomic pressures could dictate an outcome that may alienate the\nneighborhood. He stated that he lives next to property that is the subject of\nredevelopment. He added that there are other non-conforming lots that can be\nrezoned and will over time will be subject to the same redevelopment pressures\nand bad outcome. The amendment that he drafted applies to other properties and\ncommented about unintended consequences. He spoke about the 9 Donnell Street\nwhich is the subject of the amendment which is a two family worker's cottage\nbuilt in the l850's. Mr. Cohen proceeded with his presentation\n\nHe stated that the house at 9 Donnell Street is relatively small with a two\ncar garage on a lot that is 6,000 square feet. This property was owned for\nsixty years by one owner but recently is in the hands of a developer. Because\nof the narrowness of the lot there is a push to remove the existing house. The\ncurrent owner has brought the proposal to the Planning Board which has\napproved the proposal in principal which would have two different structures\nin the style of a townhouse, with a courtyard in the middle with underground\nparking underneath. The neighbors were told by the property owners that there\nis an alternative and they can build by right one long structure with a garage\nstructure in front, view I is what the structure would look like from the\nstreet. It is his understanding that this is what the developer wants to build\non the site with Planning Board approval. During the Planning Board hearing\nthe Planning Board members questioned whether the development was economically\nviable. He stated that the zoning could be amended to prohibit this or the\nPlanning Board could grant a special permit. He wanted to get ahead of this\nsituation before the structure is built. He depicted a reasonable development\nthat has a garage. He spoke about the technical and spiritual aspects of this\nproposal. He stated that 101 Orchard Street depicts frontage of a house and a\ngarage. This amendment would only effect a narrow group of properties that are\ndimensional non-conforming lots where there is a garage. He spoke of the law\nof unintended consequences. He commented that developers are looking at lots\nas an economic proposition. He wanted development done in a tasteful way that\ndoes not upset neighborhood values. He stated that within the first 50 feet of\nland a garage should not be built, but could apply to the Planning Board for a\nspecial permit. He explained the structure of his petition. He stated that\nSection B (2) of his petition deals with demolition during the pendency period\nof the special permit application and covers historical signification\nproperties that are being torn down. This will codify the current practice.\nMr. Cohen stated that Section C deals with if the petition is challenged by\ndevelopers and struck down this would just prohibit garages in the front 50\nfeet. He spoke about the memo written by Community Development start. He\nstated that language in his petition needs to be clarified. It is not the\nintention to prohibit parking rather where parking is put. He wanted to find a\nbalance for the neighborhood and developer with neighborhood values being\nprimary. He noted that the language in his petition needs refinement.\n\nPeter L. Cohen, petitioner - Presentation (Attached)\n\nRelated Agenda Items\n\n1. A zoning petition has been received From Peter L. Cohen, with regard to a proposed amendment to the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance to restrict garage development in dimensionally non-conforming lots.\n\nAPP 2016 # 3\n\n2. A communication was received from Donna P. Lopez, City Clerk, transmitting information on the Cohen Zoning Petition - Legal Ad.\n\nCOF 2016 # 5\n\n3. That a public hearing be held before the City Council or, if appointed, the Ordinance Committee on the zoning petition filed by Peter L. Cohen.\n\nO #12 2016\n\nCouncillor Kelley\n\nCity staff\n\nMayor Simmons requested Mr. Roberts to explain the memo from CDD.\n\nMr. Roberts spoke that the memo prepared for the review of the planning\nissues. He stated that the Planning Board will hear the petition on March 8.\nThe memo contains an overview of the petition. The full impact of the petition\nhave not been fully studied and Residence B is a common zoning district which\ncontains about 4,000 lots and have not studied how many of these lots are non-\nconforming. It is not typical for lots to be narrower than the 50 foot lot\nwidth. In the current zoning ordinance between Articles Five and Six there are\na set of different requirements pertaining to parking facilities, both in\nstructured parking facilities such as garages as well as surface parking.\nThere are restrictions currently in place for smaller lots and there is more\nflexibility. The issue raised with this proposal is the balance between the\nrequirement that housing when created has to provide parking at one space per\nunit and must meet the dimensional requirement in the zoning verses having\nadditional restrictions that would limit where the parking is allowed to go\nand be designed on the lot. Relief is sought by a special permit from the\nPlanning Board or variance from the Board of Zoning Appeal. Mr. Roberts added\nthat the petitioner did not some of the technical points made. One is that the\nproposed provision is cited in Article Ten, the procedures section, of the\nzoning. What is being proposed is more of a development control and belongs in\nArticle 5 of the zoning. He commented on the terminology of multi-family which\nis standard term in zoning and building codes that refers to three units or\nmore. Sections B and C in the petition that discusses procedures for special\npermit relief provisions are unusual compared to the way that special permits\nare typically provided for in the zoning. When there is a special permit\nprovision there is criteria cited and if the Planning Board or BZA finds that\nthe project meets the zoning requirements and the criteria outlined in the\nzoning then the special permit will be granted; variances require proving\nhardship to have the zoning requirement relieved. These provisions if passed\nneeds to be reviewed to determine the legal appropriateness of the language.\n\nPeter L. Cohen, et al., Zoning Petition - Community Development Memo.\n\nPublic Comment\n\nAt this time Mayor Simmons opened the hearing to public comment.\n\nCharles Teague, 23 Edmonds Street, stated that he is the project manager for\nthe lot that is the target of this petition. He noted that this project is\ntargeted because it is next door to Attorney Cohen. He stated that this\npetition is illegal. He noted that for Part A there is a letter from the\ntrustee of 9 Donnell Street, Mr. Robert McHale has been sent to the City\nCouncil and is written protest to the petition ([COMMUNICATION\n#3](http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&MeetingID=1553&MediaPosition=&ID=2056&CssClass=)).\nThe memo points that Part A is illegal in Massachusetts and alleged that this\nis reverse spot zoning. This petition singles out one or more parcels and is\nmore restrictive than other lots in the same area. He noted that the memo from\nMr. McHale points out that it is unclear why the proposed requirements will\nonly apply to such non-conforming lots and not to other lots in the same\ndistrict. He stated that the quantity and characteristics of the parcels that\nwill be affected by the Cohen petition must be known and that the petitioner\ndid not do this research. He stated that he has had previous petitions that\nhave been enacted by the City Council. He spoke of a previous petition\nsubmitted that failed to pass that contained language that a special permit\nmay normally be granted to be in compliance with state law that a special\npermit may be granted. The public was questioning why special permits were\nalways approved. He noted that it was disappointing that the City Council did\nnot seek a legal opinion on this that was offered by the City Solicitor. He\nannounced that the approval process is set by state case law. He noted that\nPart B of the petition tries to change the approval process and override state\nlaw. He concluded that this petition is a waste of time because it is illegal.\n\nJohn Tittmann, 29 Kelley Street, spoke about the livability of the streets in\nCambridge. This petition addresses an important issues. Street need to be\nbuilt and a zoning process created that insures that streets are for people to\nwalk on; not designed to make it more comfortable for cars. Convenient streets\ncreated for automobiles make it dangerous for walking. He stated that putting\ngarage doors against street sidewalks is not good for urbanism.\n\nBill Wendel, 97A Garden Street, stated that garages will fade in importance in\nour lifetime. He stated that the question needs to be asked is what the future\nof garages is. Garages are being turned into livable space.\n\nOn a motion of Councillor Devereux public comment closed at 6:10 PM on a voice\nvote of six members.\n\nCity Council Discussion\n\nCouncillor Mazen agreed with the petitioners that cars are a dying breed and\ngarages need to comport with certain ascetic qualities. He expressed his\nfrustration with the neighbor/developer conflicts and that there is immense\nroom for a win-win situation in this matter and that filing a zoning petition\nis a last resort. There is little attempt to make the developer happy because\nin this case the developer is someone in the neighborhood who owns property\nand wants to make money from the property. He stated properties should not be\nallowed to make money; it should be used for housing. In this situation the\ndesigns are not unseemly; the neighborhood could have helped with the designs.\nHe noted that the antagonism is such that it would be difficult to arrive at a\nwin-win situation. He felt that the reverse spot zoning character of this\npetition is illegal. He wants to say yes and this petition is not working in\nthis vein. He expressed his frustration with this situation and wished\nneighborhoods could solve these problems substantively.\n\nCouncillor Devereux questioned Mr. Roberts if there is problem with garages in\nRes. B would CDD have been thinking about this otherwise. Mr. Roberts\nresponded that this is not an issue that has been brought to his intention. He\nstated that he was not aware of garages being put into the front of small\nresidential lots. The project cited by the petitioner is a case before the\nPlanning Board and the deals with two separate structures on a lot. He stated\nthat the provision of the zoning causes the developers to put forth a single\nstructure design that is deliberately unattractive because the provisions of\nthe zoning stated that the Planning Board has to make a determination that the\ndevelopment of two structures is superior to a single structure. Councillor\nDevereux noted that as long as this petition is active the developer is\nblocked from doing anything. She questioned if the special permit is granted\ndoes this petition stop the demolition and the development is less\neconomically viable the longer there is delay. Mr. Roberts responded that the\nspecial permit was decided but the decision has not filed. He further stated\nthat because the decision was not filed before the petition was advertised and\nif the zoning were adopted it would be effective retroactively to the date\nwhen it was first advertised. If the City Council choses to adopt the petition\nthe Donnell Street project would be subject to petition because the special\npermit has not been filed before the first advertisement date. The current\nstatus of the Special Permit depends on what the City Council decides to do.\nThe Inspectional Services Department will not issue a building permit if the\nproject is in this uncertain stage of not knowing if the project conforms to\nthe zoning. Before a building permit is issued this petition must be resolved.\n\nCouncillor Maher added that the work done would be done at jeopardy due to the\npetition. Mr. Roberts agreed that if a building permit were issued the\ndeveloper would be building at risk and if the City Council adopted the\npetition the developer would have to alter the project or seek additional\nrelief. Councillor Maher commented that there is more going on than what is\nhappening at Donnell Street. This is an extremely tight street and\nneighborhood and people are frustrated. He understands the frustration when\npeople want to change the neighborhood. He is eager to hear what the Planning\nBoard will say about this petition and how many properties this does effects.\nHe added that this neighborhood has been underseiged and the City Council has\na responsibility to act on the changes to this neighborhood. He stated that\nchanges will be coming to Concord Avenue.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern stated that he hoped that issues are resolved in a\ncollaborative way. He stated that there is an issue on Kinnaird Street where a\nsecond dwelling was built with a garage in front that has caused concern for\nthe neighbors. He wanted a legal opinion and what the PB has to say. He wanted\nto hear the risk that the City is taking on this matter. He stated that there\nis creditability on this. He wanted a legal opinion.\n\nMayor Simmons stated that this petition could be referred to the Ordinance\nCommittee.\n\nCouncillor Toomey moved to keep the matter in committee. The motion carried on\na voice vote of 6 members.\n\nThe following e-mails were received and made part of the report.\n\nI.  Communications\n\n1. A communication was received from Mike Phillips, 57 Madison Ave, in opposition to the Cohen zoning petition.\n\n2. A communication was received from Dexter Eames, 6 Avon Place, in opposition to the Cohen zoning petition.\n\n3. A communication was received from Robert McHale, Trustee of the 9 Donnell Street Realty Trust, in opposition to the Cohen zoning petition.\n\n4.

Each year since 1999,\nthe City has received these ratings from Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Standard\n&amp; Poor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings. This achievement allows the City to invest\nmore money into important projects throughout Cambridge with a favorable\ninterest rate. The agencies highlighted the City\u2019s conservative budgeting\npractices and prudent use of reserves to help keep tax levy increases at a\nmoderate level to cover operating expenditures.  \n  \nThese ratings are in conjunction with the City\u2019s sale of $35 million in\nGeneral Obligation bonds, which took place on March 1, 2016. This sale will\nfinance capital projects such as the King Open/Cambridge Street Upper School\nand Community Complex, sewer reconstruction, street and sidewalk\nreconstruction, and other municipal and school building renovations.  \n  \nAll three agencies have given the City a positive outlook. However, in\nreviewing Moody\u2019s criteria, it is important that we continue to pay attention\nto the factors listed below to ensure our AAA rating in the future.  \n\n\u00b7 Material growth in the debt burden\n\n\u00b7 Deterioration of the tax base or weakening of the local economy\n\n\u00b7 Trend of operating deficits that lead to a significant reduction in reserve\nlevels\n\n\u00b7 Significant increases in pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB)\nliabilities\n\n  \nBased on this ongoing recognition from the rating agencies, the City Council\ncan be justly proud of its sound fiscal policies. Additionally, I would like\nto thank the City\u2019s Department Heads and staff for their commitment to\nprudently managing their budgets and programs. The City is fortunate to have\nsuch a strong and dedicated team.\n\n  \nAttached are the rating opinions of Fitch Ratings, Moody\u2019s Investors Service,\nand Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s Corporation.\n\n",

At the time of the appropriation, an estimate was used. In order\nto complete the purchase, an additional $42,655 is required.\n\nBACKGROUND: The 2005 Concord-Alewife Plan identified the acquisition of the\nremaining Watertown Branch parcels and creation of a path as a priority for\nthe area in order to create additional off-road connections to Danehy Park,\nFresh Pond Mall and to create the possible future connection to a multiuse\npath along the Fitchburg Line to Porter Square. At that time a zoning overlay\ndistrict was created to encourage the preservation of the rail line as open\nspace and conversion to a greenway and multi-use path.\n\nFUTURE PLAN: This path will be an extension of the existing path along Fresh\nPond Parkway that is also currently being extended into Watertown through a\npartnership between the City of Cambridge and the state Department of\nConservation and Recreation (DCR) known as the Watertown Cambridge Greenway.\nFunds would also be used to complete a conceptual design needed to identify\nopportunities, constraints and an approximate cost to construct the path in\nthe future.\n\nAlewife is a busy area with many transportation needs and opportunities. A\nrobust and expanding off-road, multi-use path network is part of those\nfacilities, and is needed to encourage sustainable trips in the Alewife area\nto reduce existing congestion. Paths through the area make many regional\nconnections into Arlington (Minuteman Bikeway), Belmont (Alewife Greenway\nExtension), and Somerville (Alewife Greenway). The extended Watertown-\nCambridge Greenway will complete the connection between Cambridge and\nWatertown as well as the regional link between the Minuteman Bikeway and the\nCharlies River path system.\n\n",

As\nthe severity of the drought in Massachusetts continues, the usable capacity\nremaining in our reservoir system has been declining due to insufficient\nrainfall. However, Cambridge is not at risk of running out of water because in\naddition to our own water supply, we are a member of the MWRA system, which is\noperating at normal conditions for this time of year.\n\nBased on the current reservoir levels and the need to maintain the operability\nof the water treatment plant, the CWD initiated the use of MWRA water the\nsecond week of October. This approach will allow CWD to maintain enough water\nin our reservoirs to allow the water treatment plant to continue operating at\na minimum of 10 MG per week through the fall of 2017 when the current weather\npredictions indicate that the drought will end.\n\nIn addition to purchasing water, CWD has expanded our conservation efforts\nwith top users and universities and will continue to strongly encourage the\npractice of indoor and outdoor water conservation wherever possible. While\nadditional conservation efforts are an important tool for all users of our\nwater system to participate in, Cambridge\u2019s robust water conservation/water\nefficiency programs over the past two decades have resulted in Cambridge users\nusing significantly less water per user than other communities in the\nCommonwealth and will make this more challenging to find significant water\nusage savings.\n\nAt the plant output of ~10MG per week the cost of MWRA water is estimated to\nbe $1.2M per month.\n\nOur plan, if necessary, is to appropriate funding on a quarterly basis with\nthis being our first appropriation from the water fund balance.\n\nBecause of the significant cost increases that the CWD will incur by\npurchasing water from the MWRA, there will be future financial impacts to the\nCity. The CWD will continuously monitor the drought and precipitation status\nand modify our operational plan to minimize MWRA water usage while maintaining\nplant operations and a \u201chealthy\u201d reservoir system. This will also have an\neffect on the FY18 water rate and impact the FY18 operating and capital\nbudgets.\n\n",

(the \u201cChamber\u201d) with regard to the City\u2019s eminent domain taking of the\nChamber\u2019s property on June 13, 2016. The property is a parcel of land\ncomprising approximately 5,000 square feet of land located at 859\nMassachusetts Avenue, Cambridge (the \u201cProperty\u201d). On June 13, 2016, the\nCouncil approved an Order to take the Property by eminent domain and an Order\nappropriating the estimated pro tanto payment to be paid to the Chamber for\nthe Property in the amount of One Million, Three Hundred Sixty-Three Thousand,\nEight Hundred Seventy-Five ($1,363,875) Dollars, as damages deemed sufficient\nby the Chief Assessor to cover the estimated pro tanto payment (the average\nthree prior years\u2019 assessed value plus twenty-five 25% percent (the Factor\nMaximum Value)) toward the expenses of acquisition as required by the\npreviously referenced Sections of Chapters 40 and 43 of the General Laws. This\nis the maximum that the City can pay as a pro tanto payment for a property\nthat is being taken by eminent domain.  \n  \nAs I informed the Council, under the law, the property owner has the right to\nchallenge the amount of the pro tanto payment in a legal proceeding and could\nseek to persuade a court that it is entitled to the actual fair market value\nof the property as well as certain other statutory damages such as relocation\ncosts. I informed you on June 13 that I would initiate a settlement of any\nsuch claim with the property owner once the City Council voted to authorize\nthe taking of this Property by eminent domain.  \n  \nThe Council authorized me in Executive Session to negotiate a value to be paid\nin settlement of the Chamber\u2019s damages claim in the event that the Property\nwas taken by eminent domain. As previously discussed with the Council in\nExecutive Session, I have obtained a confidential appraisal of the Property\nwhich was performed by Mr. Steven Foster. Mr. Foster has determined in his\nappraisal that the fair market value of the Property is Two Million, Six\nHundred Thousand ($2,600,000) Dollars.  \n  \nI am pleased to report that after obtaining and reviewing the appraisal from\nMr. Foster I have successfully reached a settlement with the Chamber to\nresolve the damages claim, which will result in the total amount to be paid to\nthe Chamber for the Property of Two Million, Six Hundred Thousand ($2,600,000)\nDollars. In exchange for the additional payment of One Million, Two Hundred\nThirty-Six Thousand, One Hundred Twenty-Five ($1,236,125) Dollars, the City\nwill receive an executed general release from the Chamber which will release\nthe City from any and all further liability to the Chamber arising out of this\neminent domain taking of the Property. I am therefore returning to the Council\nnow to request a further appropriation in the amount of One Million, Two\nHundred Thirty-Six Thousand, One Hundred Twenty-Five ($1,236,125) Dollars,\nwhich would constitute a final agreed total damages award to the Chamber in\nthe amount of Two Million, Six Hundred Thousand ($2,600,000) Dollars for the\ntaking of this Property; and I am further requesting that the Council\nauthorize me to settle the damages claim in that amount.\n\n  \n  \nI look forward to discussing this matter with you and answering any questions\nthat you may have.\n\n",

For additional information, please see\nattachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Lisa Peterson, dated September 19,\n2017.\n\nThe CPA process began with a public meeting held on June 22, 2017, to solicit\nsuggestions on CPA projects for FY2018. Based on that meeting and other\ninputs, the CPAC was provided information on project funding requests. A\npublic hearing was held on July 27, 2017, to solicit recommendations from the\npublic on percentage allocations. The CPAC also received several petitions,\nletters and e-mails along with online project requests from the public\nrelative to CPA recommendations. The CPAC, on September 19, 2017, unanimously\nvoted for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historical\nPreservation Projects and 10% for Open Space Projects.\n\nIn accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City\nCouncil appropriate a total of $12,832,848 in CPA funds raised by the City's\nFY2018 CPA surcharge, the FY2017 state match funds received in FY2018 and a\nportion of the existing CPA fund balance and funds currently in the Open Space\nReserve and Historic Preservation Reserve fund.\n\nFor this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the\nCPA surcharge for FY2018 will total $9,000,000, added to an anticipated FY2017\nstate match of approximately $1,470,000 and an additional $2,100,000 from CPA\nFund Balance.

   "item_body": "I am writing with regard to the City\u2019s previous submission of a Home Rule\nPetition to the Legislature whereby I requested authorization to include in\nthe planned reconstruction (the \u201cProject\u201d) of the King Open / Cambridge Street\nUpper School and Community Complex (\u201cKOCSUS\u201d) the area that is presently\noccupied by the public swimming pool known as the Gold Star Pool (the \u201cPool\nSite\u201d) and to construct subsurface geothermal wells in a portion of Donnelly\nField that lies directly along and adjacent to the current southerly boundary\nof the KOCSUS site. Both the area proposed for the construction of the\nsubsurface geothermal wells and the Gold Star Pool are presently owned and\nheld by the City for \u201cpublic park and park\u201d purposes and therefore are\nprotected under Article 97 from any change in use absent legislation\nauthorizing such a change in use.  \n  \nIn order to proceed with the design of the Project as planned, to construct\nthe subsurface geothermal wells within a portion of Donnelly Field and to\nrelocate the Gold Star Pool Site as part of the overall Project, I previously\nrequested that the City Council vote in favor of filing a Home Rule Petition.\nAs I previously informed you in my original submission to the Council with\nregard to the proposed home rule petition, the new location of the Gold Star\nPool, which will be adjacent to Berkshire Street and Donnelly Field, will be\nbeneficial to the City and the community because it allows for a larger pool\nand deck space, a new wading pool, and it faces south with a direct connection\nto Donnelly Field. The new location allows better visibility from Berkshire\nStreet and Donnelly Field. The new pool house and changing rooms will be\nlocated on the first level of the three story building, and the school\nadministrative offices will be located above the pool house and changing\nrooms.  \n  \nOn August 1, 2016, the City Council voted in favor of filing the proposed Home\nRule Petition and the Home Rule Petition was duly filed. The Petition went\nthrough both the House and the Senate. However, the City was recently informed\nby a representative of the state\u2019s Executive Office of Environmental Affairs\n(\u201cEOEA\u201d) that the City\u2019s project description and plans, which appeared to\nreduce the amount of existing open space to a smaller amount of open space,\nwere disfavored by the Legislature. EOEA also pointed out that the square\nfootage of open space that the City referenced in its proposed legislation\n(11,733 sf) included only the relocated swimming pool, and that the relocated\npool house structure, that will have two additional levels of school\nadministration offices above it, is not included in the area to be protected\nas open space. We were informed that EOEA believes that the proposed Home Rule\nPetition would be more likely looked upon favorably by the Legislature if it\nwere to include all of the relocated pool area as part of the open space area,\nincluding the pool house structure, even though the relocated pool house\nstructure would be located at the ground level of a structure that would have\ntwo additional floors of school administration office space above it. By\nincluding all of the relocated pool area and pool house structure as part of\nthe open space area, the new open space area including the pool house\nstructure will be larger than the Pool Area at its existing location, and the\noverall open space area will be increased from the existing 17,892 square feet\nto the new 18,459 square feet.  \n  \nRelief is also required from the Legislature to construct subsurface\ngeothermal wells within a portion of Donnelly Field that lies directly along\nand adjacent to the southern edge of the School Site. All existing \u201cpublic\npark and park\u201d uses that are conducted in that part of Donnelly Field will\ncontinue to be conducted after the installation of the subsurface geothermal\nwells and reconstruction of the existing recreational facilities at that part\nof the site. This part of the original Home Rule Petition remains unchanged.  \n  \nI am therefore requesting that you approve the submission of the attached\namended Home Rule Petition to the Legislature. I have also attached for your\ninformation a plot plan showing (a) the existing swimming pool area, (b) the\nproposed swimming pool area, and (c) the proposed geothermal pool area, and\nsite renderings showing the existing and proposed site conditions and\ncalculations relating to the existing and proposed pool locations at the\nproposed Project Site.\n\n",

   "item_body": "Please find attached a loan order requesting the authorization to refund prior\nbond issue(s). The purpose is to refinance existing General Obligation Bonds\nto acquire lower interest rates than those currently being paid.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe City, in conjunction with its Financial Advisor and Bond Counsel, closely\nmonitors the market for favorable conditions which would potentially allow for\nthe City to reduce its debt service costs. The last time that the City was\nable to take advantage of market conditions was in 2015, when the City\nrefinanced certain eligible bonds allowing it to realize savings of just over\n$2 million in debt service costs. This process of recalling bonds and\nreissuing them to achieve a lower interest rate is common practice. The\nability to take advantage of lower interest costs, if market conditions\npermit, is received favorably by the rating agencies and demonstrates prudent\ndebt management practices and is included in our debt policy, which is\nprojected to result in a savings just under $2 million.\n\nTiming:\n\nThe Refunding is to occur in late May or early June. If, between now and June,\nmarket conditions should deteriorate such that it no longer meets the required\nthresholds, the loan order allows for the City to take no further action, and\nnot proceed with the sale.\n\n",
